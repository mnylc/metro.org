### Description   

The Moving Image and Archive Preservation (MIAP) program situated within the Department of Cinema Studies in the Kanbar Institute of Film & Television in NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts is currently searching for a Project Manager to support its Regional Media Legacies (RML) project. The RML is provided by support from the Robert D. L. Gardiner Foundation to train NYU archivists on the management and care of film, video, audio, and digital media held across Long Island and New York City (Queens and Brooklyn, specifically). The RML was created because regional collections, like the ones we hope to find in Long Island and New York City, have been historically undervalued and often go unpreserved. The RML will honor the unique, informative, often powerful stories that local media, given the attention and care of an archivist, can continue to tell. Media made for regional audiences, especially those housed in institutions that lack archival resources or the skills of audiovisual specialists, often constitute what libraries and archives call hidden collections—rare recordings that capture local history and culture in a way that larger and better-resourced media collections often do not. Indeed, most films and videotapes cannot be found in the handful of national film and video archives, but rather in smaller cultural memory institutions. The archival profession and scholarly community now recognize that local television, home movies, the works of independent artists, and region-specific productions tend to document lives and communities that are often invisible to national media and the entertainment industry. Additional information about the project can be found here. NYU MIAP’s RML will launch its core program in Fall 2019, and so a search is currently underway for a Project Manager.


### Responsibilities   

This is a 12-month consultant position, with the opportunity to renew annually.

The Project Manager will support the MIAP program in implementing and managing the RML project and will report to the MIAP Director. The Project Manager will also design, manage, and implement specific initiatives to help local institutions to archive and preserve audiovisual recordings that document the history, culture, art, and people of Long Island and New York City. The work will take place on-site at a variety of locations across the region. Emphasis will be on partnering with nonprofit and heritage organizations lacking resources to care for audiovisual legacy materials, particularly those without archivists trained in handling such collections. The consultant will design materials for dissemination, produce website and social media content, as well as prepare correspondence and other communication materials. The Program Manager may be based anywhere within the region but travel to selected sites is required.

The Project Manager will coordinate:

Recruitment of post-graduate fellows and MIAP student interns;

Fellowship site recruitment, matching, orientation, and semester-long monitoring;

Internship site recruitment and semester-long supervision;

Supplemental internship supervision at sites without appropriately trained staff;

Disbursement of project funds for supplies and/or vendor services;

Grant reporting; and

Project documentation.
