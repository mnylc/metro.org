### Description   

NYPL Digital is responsible for the digital transformation of our organization at a particularly critical and exciting moment for all libraries. In the service of the New York Public Library’s mission, we are working to expand e-reading opportunities across the globe; to connect the public with our rich trove of collections, services, and the expertise of our curators and librarians; to preserve and make accessible our ever-expanding audio and video collections; and to promote digital equity. Above all, we are laying the groundwork -- the digital infrastructure, processes, policies and skills -- for NYPL to become an even more vital part of public life for the next generation.

 

The Digital Imaging Unit of the New York Public Library is hiring a Mass Digitization Coordinator to refine existing digitization workflows within the DIU, explore new options for large-scale reformatting through vendors and partnerships in order to deliver as much material as possible through the Library’s own online collection portals and other digital library access sites like the HathiTrust Digital Library and the Internet Archive, and oversee the day-to-day operations and file management of large digitization projects.

 

The position will report to the Manager of Digitization Services, and will work closely with Curators, the Metadata Services Unit, the Special Collections units and divisions, Permissions and Reproductions, the Rights and Information Policy Group, and many others at the Library. A key member of the DIU leadership team, this role is designed for an enthusiastic, problem-solving individual interested in the full digitization lifecycle, from metadata and conservation to registrarial movements and preservation-quality imaging. This is an exciting opportunity to play a key role in the migration of library resources to the Internet: furthering the NYPL’s mission while working hands-on with exceptional collections in a collegial and productive environment.
