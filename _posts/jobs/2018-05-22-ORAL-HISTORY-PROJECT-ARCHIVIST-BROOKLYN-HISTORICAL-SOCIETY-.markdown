### Description   

Brooklyn Historical Society seeks an Oral History Project Archivist to process and describe a new oral history collection of roughly 50 interviews. Reporting to the Managing Director of Library & Archives and working closely with the Oral Historian, the successful candidate will be responsible for processing and describing the Muslims in Brooklyn oral history collection according to established project procedures and best practices for in-house and online access.
Muslims in Brooklyn is a two-year, public history project to amplify stories of Brooklyn’s diverse Muslim communities. For well over a century, Muslims have lived, worked, and prayed in Brooklyn, making it a major center of Muslim life for NYC and the nation. As such, the histories and experiences of Brooklyn’s Muslim communities hold great resonance for national conversations on religious diversity and pluralism. Over the course of this project, BHS will produce the following: a collection of oral histories and primary source records, a web-based educational curriculum, Educational programs, an arts-focused exhibition, dynamic public programming, dedicated segments in BHS’s Flatbush + Main podcast series, and a comprehensive publication. Together, these elements will provide learning experiences, challenge assumptions, and promote understanding about Brooklyn's rich ethnic and religious heritage.
Using ArchivesSpace to create EAD finding aids according the standards set forth in BHS’s oral history and archival processing manuals, the Archivist will be responsible for exporting that descriptive record from ASpace to BHS’s online oral history portal. Each interview will be described at the interview-level within ASpace using archival standards for description and subject access, and synced using the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS). The archivist will also be responsible for updating and maintaining procedures and policies; and additional responsibilities may include supervising of two oral history interns, and supporting reference services during the library’s open hours, including at least 1 Saturday per quarter.
