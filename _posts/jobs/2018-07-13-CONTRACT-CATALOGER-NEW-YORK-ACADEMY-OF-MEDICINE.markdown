### Description   

The New York Academy of Medicine Library holds the Margaret Barclay Wilson Collection of cookery pamphlets. The Library is seeking cataloging services for this collection. The services required will include both complex copy cataloging and original cataloging of cookery pamphlets from approximately 1870 to 1960. Most of the pamphlets are in English, but some are in foreign languages including German and French. The services form part of a digitization project of some 1200 items from the Wilson collection, and thus the cataloging portion is under a fixed time constraint for completion. Work is to be undertaken on site at the Library of the New York Academy of Medicine, using equipment provided by the Academy, and must fall within the normal working hours for the Library: Monday through Friday, 9 am to 6 pm, except holidays. The number of working hours per week is flexible, but in order to keep to project schedule, we envision that the work must proceed at a rate of at least two full days per week and must start by the beginning of August. All cataloging done under this agreement must be completed by March 2019.  The work is undertaken under an hourly reimbursement arrangement, at the rate of $25/hour. No benefits accrue to these services.


### Responsibilities   

Copy catalog pamphlets using OCLC’s Connexion client and the Library’s Integrated Library System (ILS), currently Koha through ByWater Solutions. Create original RDA records for pamphlets that do not have pre-existing records in OCLC. Create DCRM(MSS) records for manuscript recipes in the collection. 
Assign appropriate Library of Congress subject headings to the pamphlet materials. Use thesauri including RBMS controlled vocabularies and AAT. 
Assess the physical condition of the pamphlets and refer problematic items to the conservation lab. Rehouse, label, and barcode the pamphlets. 



### Qualifications   

Demonstrated ability to create original RDA catalog records. Experience handling special collections materials. Knowledge of DCRM(MSS) and manuscript cataloging preferred.


### Compensation   

$25/hour
