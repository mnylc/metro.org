### Description   

The Curator for the Arts & Humanities is a tenure-track, faculty position within the new Special Collections department. This position will be responsible for collection development, with a particular focus on archival holdings in multiple formats; exhibitions; donor relations; instruction; and outreach and programming to support, publicize and generate research in the NYU collections. Reporting to the Director of Special Collections, this individual will work closely with other members of the curatorial team and public services staff, as well as colleagues in Archival Collections Management and Preservation. 

The successful candidate will demonstrate a commitment to developing, supporting and expanding on the cultural, literary and artistic archival collections for NYU’s diverse user population, and work to find synergies between the historically separate repositories now combined as Special Collections. 


### Responsibilities   

Specific duties will include overseeing the exhibitions program, including liaison with internal colleagues and external vendors and curators; curating exhibitions that draw on the new and existing collections; maintaining comprehensive curatorial documentation; working with colleagues across the Division on processing priorities, plans, and preservation concerns; maintaining and cultivating relationships with current and prospective donors for collections and funding within the area of curatorial focus; providing individualized instruction sessions for faculty and students; working with public services staff to provide in-depth reference services to patrons. 

The NYU Special Collections collects, conserves and provides access to the material resources of the historical record from the repositories of the Fales Library, Tamiment Library & Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives and the University Archives, now combined into one administrative department. As a staff, the Special Collections strive to assemble a diverse workforce that reflects our varied user base and fosters a welcoming environment. While primarily serving the students and faculty of NYU, we also engage with local, national and international researchers, communities, institutions and individuals within a framework of learning, collaboration and respect. 

Librarians play a key role in the educational mission of NYU by establishing strong relationships with faculty and students, and connecting them to the services, content, and tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs.  They participate in Libraries-wide committees and in professional activities outside of NYU and monitor developments and best practices in academic librarianship.
