### Description   

About Us
Located in Brooklyn New York, SmartSign is committed to making signs that ensure the protection, respect and safety of others.  Internet Retailer ranks us as #428 in sales in the US. We have experienced consistent growth and profits since our founding almost 20 years ago.
SmartSign has donated tens of thousands of signs to colleges and schools as well as to non-profits such as the Wounded Warrior Project, the Boy Scouts, and Transportation Alternatives.
SmartSign has been a pioneer in developing signage in bathrooms that support the rights of people who identify as transgender and has donated all-gender toilet signs to churches, hospitals, libraries, food co-ops and public schools. With offices in India and and our headquarters in Brooklyn, SmartSign values creativity, innovation and diversity in worldview.
We are near all major subway lines. Offices feature a spectacular view of the harbor and downtown Manhattan. We have 50 team members in Brooklyn Heights and another 60 associates in Jaipur.
The culture is young, casual-dressing, fun-loving, multi-cultural, team-oriented, but very hard-working.
Customers include schools, hospitals, non-profits and businesses worldwide. The products we sell cover a broad range of industrial “niches” (e.g. traffic signs, parking signs, floor mats, bar-code tags and parking permits). The company operates over 35 niche websites.
SmartSign is an equal opportunity employer and encourages individuals from all types of backgrounds to apply.
Compensation depends on experience. Benefits include biannual bonuses, health insurance, 401(k) plan matching, paid time off, company events, sports tickets and monthly celebratory free lunches!


### Responsibilities   

Research and track regulatory changes in federal, state, local and industry codes impacting signs and labels; design new signs based on regulatory research; write and help design interpretive posters and signs; work with our art team to develop infographics based on research; manage several product page websites along with team of writers and freelancers; fulfill research requests from product managers and call service inquiries.

A Typical Week
The topics that you will need to address are both varied and incredibly specific. Examples are:
What are the latest sign requirements for swimming pools per state?
What are the rules for New York equine liability disclaimer signs?
What is the meaning and history of the red circle/slash symbol?
Does the Department of Transportation have material requirements for semi-truck reflectors?
What is good Dog Park Etiquette?
Once a question is answered by you or your team, the next steps are to work with the art and product team to create a set of signs and, finally, draft a commercial page for that product line.	




### Qualifications   

Masters in Library and/or Information Science or paralegal experience is recommended. We have a soft spot for writers with a liberal arts background.  Recent graduates as well as individuals with several years of experience are encouraged to apply. As this position is fairly new, there is room to create your own expectations for its role. Having the capability to remain flexible in job responsibilities is a must for this position.  You do not need to have background in our business, just a commitment to use your information research and people skills, energy and smarts to help us build an exciting business.
