### Description   

The Community Library Center for Regional History welcomes applications from current graduate students in the humanities, literature, museum studies, library and information studies, preservation, cultural archives, or a related program for its professional fellowship program. The program has been designed to provide practical experience to graduate students interested in pursuing a career in a special collections and historic structure setting.
The Center for Regional History is the repository for the Ernest and Mary Hemingway House collections as well as central Idaho collections regionally known in the inter-mountain West. The Center’s users range from young students to scholars from around the world. For further information about the Center for Regional History, consult the library website: [https://www.comlib.org/regional-history-about/.](https://www.comlib.org/regional-history-about/.)
Professional fellows will work on a project in an area of their specific interest within the Hemingway House collections and have a learning opportunity through the Hemingway House as a cultural landmark and the sense of place it affords. The fellow will also contribute to the integration of the Hemingway House collections, the Library’s Hemingway collections (including the oral history collection), and the Regional History Museum collections. Professional fellows will undertake and complete a research project based on their interests and skills, and the Library’s needs.


### Responsibilities   

There are two options for the Hemingway in Idaho Research Fellowship. The fellow may focus on research services or digital resources. Please consider the descriptions below and focus your application on one (see below for the fellowship details):
1. Research services, teaching, and interpretation with Hemingway collections
Working with the Regional History Director, Library and Museum staff, the professional fellow will:

•  Conduct in-depth research on a set of objects in the Hemingway House collection, an aspect of the house historic structure, or a theme related to Hemingway’s time in Idaho told through the House and/or collection.

•  Assist with and perhaps be the lead in Hemingway-related presentations at the Library.

•  Select materials and write interpretive text for one or more “collection highlights” opportunities such as the annual Ernest Hemingway Seminar, Center for Regional History open house, the Center’s Hemingway House webpages, the Regional History Museum’ Hemingway Exhibition, or the future Betty Olsen Carr Reading Room interactive kiosk.

•  Give informal talks to small interested groups.

•  Provide research support for patrons, in-person and through email.
These duties will allow the professional fellow to develop skills in key research areas of public services. The fellow will gain exposure to the complexities of sharing the research for the promotion of public history in library and museum settings. The fellow will be mindful of security and preservation considerations of all of the Library’s collections. The professional fellow will also assist Regional History staff in their goal of making the Center’s collections accessible and in supporting The Community Library’s mission.
OR
2. Digital resources
Working with the Regional History Director, Library, and Museum staff, the professional fellow will work within the following:

•  Assist with and perhaps be the lead in Hemingway-related digital exhibits on the library website, and/or digital presentations at the library or museum.

•  Help to create a digital resource center aimed at educational outreach (platform to be determined).

•  Develop specific projects, depending on a person’s skills, area of knowledge, cataloging background, and interests.

•  Develop descriptive criteria for Hemingway materials with an emphasis on developing metadata records for the Hemingway House collection that can be useful in the digital project.

•  Contribute new data to the existing databases.

•  Give informal talks to small interested groups.
These duties will allow the professional fellow to develop skills in key technological and interpretive areas of museum and library public services. The fellow will gain exposure to the complexities of interpreting the research for the promotion of public history in library and museum settings. This includes the creation of public history for users in a virtual setting. The fellow will gain experience by adding to and pulling from database records. The fellow will be mindful of security and preservation considerations of all of the Library’s collections.
