### Description   

Learn. Explore. Connect. If you are excited about strategic emphasis on Service, Engagement, Awareness, and Space, the La Grange Public Library invites you to consider becoming its next Executive Director. The seven-member Board of Trustees seeks an Executive Director who will commit to developing, enhancing and supporting new library services and programs for the community. The La Grange Public Library serves 15,600+ residents from a centrally located and highly accessible downtown building (completed in 2007). Key opportunities for the next Executive Director include implementing the current strategic plan, mentoring and working collaboratively with Library staff and community stakeholders, completing the 2018 Library renovation project, and growing new partnerships with external agencies and organizations. With a vital staff (26 FTE), a dedicated Library Board, and a $3 million annual budget, the Library seeks the leadership of a visionary and innovative Executive Director.

La Grange, an award-winning village founded in the 1800s, today bustles with activity including shopping, dining and entertainment. The community encourages and supports a wide variety of independent retailers and creates fun and enriching events that attract young families. Anchored by the La Grange Village Hall, downtown is the vibrant heart of the community offering residents an opportunity to come together, socialize, and celebrate.  Some of the buildings date from the 1890s, when retail and commercial businesses began to flourish. In addition to an active and energetic downtown, La Grange is known for its historic residential district, its pedestrian-friendly environment, and its excellent public schools. When people visit La Grange, they want to stay! Two train stations and a public bus system provide easy access to nearby suburbs and downtown Chicago. Additional information on the Library, La Grange and the position can be found at La Grange Links.
