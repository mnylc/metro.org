### Description   

Dean

University Libraries

Position Prospectus

A growing university with an inspiring mission to transform the lives of its students, Adelphi University, New York, has key elements for success in place: strong leadership, world-class faculty, a compelling new strategic plan and an extraordinary commitment to diversity. Now we seek an inspirational new dean to lead Adelphi University Libraries.

It's an exciting time in the history of Adelphi University, New York. We recently earned five Best College honors from the latest U.S. News & World Report 2020 rankings: Best College, Best College for Social Mobility, Best College for Veterans, Best Value College and Best College for First-Year Experience. We have dramatically improved our position in recently released rankings from the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education (up 43 spots), while remaining on the selective Forbes America's Top Colleges list.

Adelphi's dedication to diversity and inclusion is being nationally recognized, with two consecutive wins of the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, one of just six colleges in the state of New York to be so honored for its innovations in diversity. Due to our innovative approach to mentoring for students of color, first-generation students and LGBTQ+ students, Eduventures named Adelphi one of just four national winners of its 2019 Eduventures Innovation Award.

The dean of the University Libraries will provide academic and administrative leadership and support for the libraries' resources, services and programs. The dean will take the lead while working in a spirit of shared governance with library faculty in defining and developing the libraries' goals, policies and practices and will play a key role in implementing the University's long-range strategic vision defined within Momentum: The Strategic Plan for Adelphi University, 2015-2021—most notably, Adelphi's focus on academic excellence and its relentless dedication to student success.

University Libraries

The Adelphi University Libraries are composed of Swirbul Library and University Archives and Special Collections in the Garden City campus, and the libraries at the Manhattan, Hauppauge, and Hudson Valley Centers. The Libraries provide education, information resources, services, and facilities that advance teaching, learning, research and creative activity. As an academic department of the University, Adelphi University Libraries educate our community in the effective discovery, evaluation and use of information resources, and conduct research that informs our practice.

The University Libraries provide access to over 88,000 online journals and 235,000 e-books through 249 databases, and house over 486,000 print volumes, 400 print journal subscriptions, and 70 special collections, including 13 digital collections. Every academic department has a library faculty liaison; they are available to assist faculty in obtaining and locating resources, planning student assignments, and teaching classes in the use and evaluation of library resources.

The University Libraries are an invaluable resource to the Adelphi community and have remained so by continuously adapting to the academic and research requirements of each new generation of students. To meet the growing and changing needs for research and information, the first floor of Swirbul Library is being transformed into an interactive and consolidated service point. Focusing on creating lifelong learning and curiosity, the new information hub will provide personalized service to connect students with the appropriate experts, while faculty librarians will be on hand to provide in-depth research consultations.

Adelphi University

Located just 23 miles from New York City, Adelphi is a private university in the midst of one of the most dynamic phases of its 123-year history. With robust enrollments, an increasingly diverse student body and faculty, expanding graduate programs, and growing financial and administrative strength, Adelphi is being transformed just as it is transforming the lives of its students through its personalized approach to higher education.

Adelphi is Long Island's oldest private coeducational university, serving more than 8,100 students at its beautiful main campus in Garden City, at learning hubs in Manhattan, the Hudson Valley and Hauppauge, and online. Adelphi offers exceptional liberal arts and sciences programs and professional training, with particular strength in our Core Four—Arts and Humanities, STEM and Social Sciences, the Business and Education Professions, and Health and Wellness. Adelphi University is a highly awarded, nationally ranked, powerfully connected doctoral research university known for small classes with world-class faculty, hands-on learning, and innovative ways to support academic and career success.

With powerful partnerships throughout the New York area, more than 115,000 graduates around the country, a growing enrollment of students from 41 states and 58 countries, and rising rankings from top publications and organizations, Adelphi is strongly positioned for the future.

The University is an independent, doctoral-granting institution with more than 100 different degrees at the bachelor's, master's, doctoral and professional levels.

Our faculty and staff are dedicated to providing our students with the finest education in the region as well as offering vital services to our local communities. As the University turns its strategic plan, Momentum, into a vision for the future, the University community has come together to accomplish mutual goals centered on scholarship and student achievement.

Adelphi University comprises eight colleges and schools:

• College of Arts and Sciences
• College of Education and Health Sciences
• College of Nursing and Public Health
• College of Professional and Continuing Studies
• Gordon F. Derner School of Psychology
• Honors College
• Robert B. Willumstad School of Business
• School of Social Work

From our original Garden City, New York, footprint of three buildings, Adelphi's main campus has grown to encompass 29 buildings on 75 pastoral acres in the heart of Nassau County.

New York City ranks in the top five of the fastest-growing cities in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2016), top five most visited cities (Forbes 2016), No. 1 most economically powerful city in the world (Business Insider 2015), No. 1 most influential city in the world (Forbes 2014), No. 1 city for finance (The Telegraph 2017) and No. 1 best city in the world (Time Out 2016).

Our students, faculty and staff have access to Long Island's culture, shopping, parks and world-famous beaches. Free shuttles to and from local train stations also make the greatest city in the world just a short ride away. We enjoy trips to New York's restaurants, Broadway theaters and iconic venues such as Central Park, Ellis Island, Yankee Stadium, the Museum of Modern Art, the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center and Barclays Center.

We pride ourselves on meeting the needs of our students. In addition to full-time study, students can enroll in part-time or accelerated programs, participate in our increasing number of online courses or attend classes at one of our learning hubs—our thriving center in downtown Manhattan, a learning hub in Hauppauge and two in the Hudson Valley region.

Students and faculty need state-of-the-art resources to reach their goals. That's why the University has invested millions of dollars in infrastructure. We've renovated our facilities, upgraded technology and classrooms, dramatically improved our library facilities and collections, and invested in new equipment. An ambitious campus expansion project over the last decade resulted in the completion, opening, and enhancement of the following buildings:

• Center for Recreation and Sports
• Nexus Building—the state-of-the-art new home of the College of Nursing and Public Health as well as the Office of Academic Services and Retention and the Office of University Admissions

In addition, our Manhattan Center has been renovated and re-envisioned for a new cohort of international students, and our Ruth S. Harley University Center is undergoing a complete renovation to double our dining and gallery spaces while offering modern and accessible meeting, event, academic and lounge space.

As of Fall 2018, there are a total of 8,146 undergraduate and graduate students attending Adelphi University. Nearly 23 percent of our undergraduates live on campus.

Students work closely with faculty and peers as well as with members of local communities on projects, research and fieldwork. Adelphi students are making their mark across academic fields and country borders.

Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity encompasses the range of human differences that includes age, gender, race, ethnicity, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, socioeconomic status, belief systems, thought styles, military experience and education. At Adelphi, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe diversity is a powerful driver of innovation and open discourse, and that students, faculty and staff grow when in a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone is accepted, supported and respected.

We have made great progress as a model of diversity and inclusion. We recently appointed our first vice president for diversity and inclusion, who was key in forming the University Diversity Committee. Thanks to these efforts, Adelphi initiated the groundbreaking Diversity Certificate Program for faculty and staff, a program that local public schools are emulating. We continue to grow our mentoring programs for students of color, veterans and the LGBTQ+ community.

In 2016, Adelphi University saw the largest increase in students of color in our history. We built upon this success, revising our recruitment strategies to attract diverse faculty, students, staff and administrators. As a result, in 2017 and again in 2018, we welcomed exceptionally diverse groups of new faculty, including a cohort composed of nearly 50 percent faculty of color. Initiatives by the University's Diversity Committee and the Athletics Department's Diversity and Inclusion Council have increased openness and understanding on campus and won awards from national organizations, including a prestigious Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity, four and a half stars and Premier Campus designation from the Campus Pride Index, and recognition of President Christine M. Riordan as one of the “Top 25 Women in Higher Education and Beyond” by Diverse: Issues in Higher Education.

Additionally, the University is making our campus facilities more gender inclusive and accessible to those with both physical and mental differences.

Momentum: The Strategic Plan for Adelphi University 2015-2021

Momentum, the University's Strategic Plan, is guiding dynamic growth and development across all facets of the University. Centered on six transformational goals, Momentum seeks to advance around:

• An Emphasis on World-Class Academics - Adelphi already offers the intellectual rigor and talented faculty that create a unique educational experience. We will enhance the value of an Adelphi degree by deepening the caliber of the teaching, the programs, and the research and creative work in order to increase the impact of every student's (and professor's) years with us.
• A Relentless Focus on Student Success - As we grow, Adelphi will continue to set the standard for committing to the individual student—and growing their intellectual curiosity, ability and potential—in order to produce generations of curious, compassionate, successful people.
• A Model of Diversity and Inclusion - Adelphi's reputation as a community that values, welcomes and inspires every individual—among our students, faculty and staff—will grow on a national level.
• A Powerfully Connected University - We will extend the reach and resources of our community through a potent network of relationships. We'll bring together faculty, staff, families, alumni and business and industry partners, maximizing our traditional associations here on Long Island as well as in the great city that is our neighbor.
• Financial and Operational Strength - Growing stronger means growing smart by incrementally improving existing resources and operations, while integrating new and complementary ones, to form a seamlessly high-functioning, highly regarded enterprise.
• Global Recognition and Renown - We will become an outstanding private university, known everywhere for our academics, our four exciting New York locations and our experiential learning. Rankings, awards and media coverage will advance both our brand and the Adelphi Advantage, all around the world.

These six goals are touchstones for all aspects of the University and are grounded in concrete initiatives designed to produce measurable results in our dedication to transform the lives of our students. Read more about the Momentum plan at strategic-plan.adelphi.edu.
