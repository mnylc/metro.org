Some questions we will explore include: How do the ways we preserve, analyze, document and mobilize our collections, instruction, and services connect with the work of community activists in their fights for racial, economic, and gender justice? What does it mean to have a commitment to social justice in our profession and practice? How does librarianship embrace, challenge, or hinder various forms of access to information, documentation, and archives?
