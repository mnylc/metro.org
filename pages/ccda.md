title: Coordinated Collection Development Aid Plan 2011-2017
permalink: /ccda/
---

Through its Coordinated Collection Development Aid (CCDA) program, New York State invests in the important role academic libraries play in the state resource sharing environment. Materials purchased in a wide range of subject areas by the Metropolitan New York Library Council’s (METRO) academic library members are shared with libraries of all types through regional and statewide delivery systems, increasing the variety and number of resources available to New York State residents.
METRO’s current CCDA plan operates under the guidelines below. These guidelines have been developed by the Program Administrator for the Coordinated Collection Development Program at the State Library with the assistance of the Empire State Library Network ([ESLN](https://www.esln.org)) who administer the program at the local level. The purpose of this program is to enhance academic library collections thereby strengthening regional collections that are available via resource sharing. Accordingly,
Any library materials can be purchased under the resource sharing program by an academic institution as long as it can be lent to or used by the patrons of members of the reference and research library resources systems.

Periodicals, serials, and reference materials can be purchased as long as they can be lent to or used by patrons of members of the reference and research library resources systems. The materials need not circulate if they do not circulate to students or faculty in the home academic institution.
Electronic database costs can be paid under the resource-sharing program by an academic institution if the license permits on-site use by patrons and by members of the reference and research library resources system.
Fees paid for providing access to materials acquired through document delivery can not be included because the materials are not subsequently available for loan to others. Institutional fees such as overhead and processing charges can not be paid for with CCDA program funds.
Duplication of titles purchased with Coordinated Collection Development Program funds in different academic libraries is acceptable if the duplication meets regional collection development needs.

All use of Coordinated Collection Development Program funds presumes that there is also an ongoing and substantial commitment of institutional funds to collection development, as required in the legislation for the Coordinated Collection Development Program.
Commissioner's Regulation §90.15 (e) Maintenance of Effort states…amount expended for library materials; therefore electronic access to a database from which library material, e.g. a journal article, journal citation, or other information sources that may be retrieved and shared, can be included as part of the total library materials expenditures in order to demonstrate maintenance of collection-building efforts from year-to-year.

## CCDA Plan and Process

METRO’s CCDA Plan may be revised periodically to reflect changes in member institutions’ collection development priorities. A complete list of participating institutions and their collection foci will be posted on the METRO website with a form for members to register any changes to their collection development priorities. Revisions may also be based on recommendations by the Resource Sharing Advisory Council (to be formed in 2012) to the Board of Trustees and and the All revisions are subject to approval by METRO’s Board of Trustees and will be announced to participating members and the New York State Library Division of Library Development.
