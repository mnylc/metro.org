### Description   

The New York University Libraries seek a collaborative and knowledgeable professional to serve as the Head of Resource Management, to lead a service-oriented department in the acquisition of research resources in all formats and oversee the quality control, upload, and maintenance of associated metadata. The successful candidate will combine demonstrated acquisitions, technical services and management experience with knowledge of standards and practices for the acquiring, processing, and cataloging of resources in all formats in an academic library setting.


### Responsibilities   

Reporting to the Associate Dean for Knowledge Access and Resource Management Services (KARMS), the Head of Resource Management is a key senior managerial position within KARMS. The position provides leadership, vision, strategic direction, and expertise for a staff of 6 FTE professionals and 20 FTE paraprofessionals responsible for the acquisition of library resources, fiscal control of collections budgets, delivery management and ingest of associated metadata, and systems administration of primary resource data stores. The incumbent will closely collaborate with colleagues across the Division of Libraries, especially colleagues in the Knowledge Access Design and Development, Metadata Production and Management, and Collection and Research Services departments. Librarians are expected to serve as partners in the educational mission of NYU by establishing strong relationships with faculty and students, and providing responsive and innovative information services.

Under the general supervision of the Associate Dean for Knowledge Access and Resource Management Services, the incumbent shall:
- Work with the Resource Management supervisors and staff to nurture a culture of innovation, experimentation, and assessment
- Identify and apply best-practices in:
-- Acquisition of library resources and associated metadata
-- Implementation of ordering, receipt, payment, and reporting workflows
-- Design and management of library resource data stores, including those for library acquisitions, serial holdings, electronic resource access, metadata delivery, and collections budgets and related financial transactions
-- Creation and modification of resource management data and bibliographic records using recognized standards
-- Application of workflow automation particularly as it relates to batch ingest of MARC formatted metadata
- Demonstrate superior management ability by encouraging accountability, fostering collaboration, and providing timely feedback
- Collaborate with other members of the KARMS management team in the ongoing improvement of KARMS automated and manual processes to meet institutional goals and improve service to users
- Lead library initiatives and projects that have a resource management emphasis, and contribute resource management expertise to NYU campus partner initiatives
- Serve on relevant library standing committees and teams, including the Department Managers Group, E-Access Steering Committee, and the materials budget oversight team
- Engage in professional activities, especially those related to all modes of research resource acquisition, as well as the implementation and management of related processes and data stores

Collections curated, managed, and preserved by the NYU Libraries include in round numbers 5 million book volumes (of which 1.1 million are electronic), 270,000 serial titles (of which 120,000 are electronic), and 43,000 linear feet of archival materials. As NYU Libraries devote more resources to acquiring specialized and unique materials while maintaining core collection strengths, the Head of Resource Management will play a key role in maintaining a library acquisition and licensing environment that encompasses a broad range of resources, collections, and metadata. To that end, the Libraries currently deploy the Ex Libris Aleph integrated library system, the Ex Libris SFX OpenURL link resolver, and Primo discovery interface.
