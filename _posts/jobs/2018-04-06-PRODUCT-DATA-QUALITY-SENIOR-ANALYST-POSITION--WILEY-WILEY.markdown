### Description   

As a Senior Analyst, Product Data Quality you’ll be responsible for leading daily product data quality and support activities related to the Product Data Quality team. We’re looking for someone who can audit the health of product data and make recommendations to improve quality and workflow. We’ll also need you to help remediate data issues and establish standards where necessary. Creating and analyzing reporting is a large part of the role, so you’ll be able to look at data and find root causes of problems. Familiarity with data needs, integration and governance across a global organization at a metadata-level is required. You will be a key part of the team, collaborating with the product data management functional groups and other parts of the business to develop best practices, policies and procedures. Although this is not a management role, the successful candidate will guide junior members of the team and help make decisions that will be executed by senior leadership. 




### Qualifications   

We’re looking for someone who is enthusiastic about data, curious, with an investigative mind. A background in book publishing data would be helpful. Some understanding of workflow in technology solutions and experience working with technical needs is desired, as you’ll need to translate between business needs and technical solutions. Advanced Excel skills are a must, and knowledge of KPIs and data visualization is an advantage. Knowledge of databases and experience with technologies such as SQL and SAP would be desirable.  You should have a degree in Library & Information Science, Data Analytics, or a similar field, together with at least four years of experience in a data intensive role. A Masters Degree is preferred. You will also need a good understanding of information and systems design and how it relates to underlying data structures. 


### Compensation   

People have always been valued at Wiley. We work collaboratively, enjoy what we do and have opportunities to develop throughout our careers. And the rewards are impressive. Which means you can look forward to a competitive salary, defined contribution pension scheme, ample holiday time (pro rata), third staff discounts and employee assistance program.
