Are you passionate about providing programs and services to children and their families?  Do you love creativity, playful learning, and exploring new ideas, while producing fun and educational experiences?   Then come join us at the White Plains Public Library.

The White Plains Public Library has an opening for a Librarian I to work in The Trove, our library for children. One of the busiest public libraries in New York State, the White Plains Public Library values excellent customer service as well as innovation and experimentation in services and programs.

The City of White Plains is located 25 miles north of New York City in Westchester County. Home to 57,000 residents, the City’s population expands to 150,000 every workday as thousands of people travel to the City for work or school. The modern downtown has enjoyed a recent revitalization with expanded shopping and dining options. With a Metro North commuter railroad station and a bus transit center, people from all over Westchester County make White Plains a destination for work, leisure and study.

The White Plains Public Library serves the City through one facility, located in downtown White Plains. With a staff of 42 FTE, in 2016 the Library attracted nearly 30,000 people to its programs and circulated over 700,000 items. In addition to the Trove, the library for children, in 2013 the Library opened the Edge, an innovative library for teens that includes a digital media lab. Recently the Library opened the Hub, a library for adults that includes a café and bookstore.

The City of White Plains is an Equal Opportunity Employer
