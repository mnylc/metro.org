### Description   

Lead an innovative and accomplished New York library system to continue outstanding levels of service and effective resource sharing. The Board of Trustees of the Mid-Hudson Library System ([http://midhudson.org/)](http://midhudson.org/)) (or MHLS – headquartered in Poughkeepsie, NY), seeks an experienced library leader—responsive to member, staff, and community needs and skilled in focusing the efforts of a team of talented professionals—as its next Executive Director. MHLS, a regional system of sixty-six public libraries in Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Putnam, and Ulster counties, works in partnership with its member libraries providing access to excellent library services for 650,000+ NY residents. With a $3.4 million annual budget and 22 system staff, MHLS is a member-focused model organization with a stellar reputation for collaborative planning and process, resulting in the 5 Year Plan of Service (2017-2021) ([http://midhudson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Board-State-Approved-Mission-Statement-Goal-Statements-Intended-Results-Evaluation-Methods.pdf).](http://midhudson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Board-State-Approved-Mission-Statement-Goal-Statements-Intended-Results-Evaluation-Methods.pdf).)
