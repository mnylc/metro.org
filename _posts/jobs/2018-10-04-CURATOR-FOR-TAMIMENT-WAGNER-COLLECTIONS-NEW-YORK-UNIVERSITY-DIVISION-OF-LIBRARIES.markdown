### Description   

The New York University Division of Libraries seeks a Curator for Tamiment-Wagner Collections in its Special Collections Department. The successful candidate will have deep knowledge of the history of radical politics and labor, a strong and well-documented commitment to public service librarianship, a record of teaching and scholarship relevant to the Tamiment-Wagner collections, an understanding of information technology and its implications for libraries and archives, and an ability to bring vision and strategic thought to the development of the collections and their use by students and scholars. The incumbent will also develop and administer an extensive array of public programming, including forums, seminars, and other events related to our collections.

At the Division of Libraries, we are proud of our organizational culture and we are committed to building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization that supports a sense of belonging for the staff and communities we serve.

About the Tamiment Collections
The Tamiment Collections encompass one of the finest research resources in the country documenting the history of radical politics: socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the cultural left, the New Left, and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties. Utopian experiments, women's movements, and other forms of radical activity are well-documented in the growing collections. Although the focus of Tamiment holdings is the United States since 1865, Great Britain, Canada and other foreign countries are well-represented in the collections. The four primary components of the Collections are:

Political Radicalism: Tamiment holds the official archives of the Communist Party, USA, and the Daily Worker newspaper, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist of America, as well as the papers of Eugene Debs, James and Esther Jackson, Michael Harrington, and Howard Zinn ([https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276867&p=1846310).](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276867&p=1846310).)

Labor: Tamiment is the official repository of New York City’s Central Labor Council and holds the archives of many of its unions, including UAW District 65, the United Federation of Teachers, and AFSCME District Council 37 ([https://guides.nyu.edu/labor).](https://guides.nyu.edu/labor).)

Cold War: Tamiment holds many collections relating to the Cold War and its effect on U.S. society. These holdings include the papers of the Nation magazine, Phillip Agee, Howard Zinn, Alger Hiss, and the film archive of Estela Bravo ([https://guides.nyu.edu/coldwar).](https://guides.nyu.edu/coldwar).)

Archives of Irish America: The Archives of Irish America is part of the Tamiment Library. This important collection documents the Irish Diaspora in America, its relationship to the American labor movement, to New York City history, and to American culture and society in general. The collection includes the Mick Moloney Irish-American Music and Popular Culture Collection, one of the largest collections in the U.S. for the study of Irish-American music and popular culture ([https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276867&p=5445936).](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276867&p=5445936).)
