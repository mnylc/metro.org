### Description   

The Diamond Law Library at Columbia University seeks applicants with seven or more years of progressively responsible law library experience for the newly-created position of Assistant Director for Special Projects. The Assistant Director for Special Projects position is tasked with helping support the Law Library in developing and completing Special Projects and positioning the Law Library to respond to opportunities and challenges that occur. The person in this position has ultimate responsibility for the management of projects identified by the Law Library Director and other members of the Planning Group. The position’s responsibilities include every aspect of the project management, including identification, planning, budgetary considerations, and implementation. These projects may be contained within the Law Library (either intra-departmental and inter-departmental), or may include stakeholders from within the larger Law School, University, or other institutions. As a member of the senior administrative group, the Law Library Planning Group, the Assistant Director for Special Projects also helps chart the course of the Law Library.

The Assistant Director for Special Projects also serves as the head of the Columbia Law Library Fee-Based Services Department and supervises the staff of that department, including two Officers of Administration. The Assistant Director for Special Projects must produce and maintain a separate departmental budget and make long-term policy and other decisions regarding the department’s operations, scope of service, technology, and staffing. The Assistant Director for Special Projects also assists with complex legal bibliography requests from subscribers and customers.

The Assistant Director for Special Projects also shares in responsibility for Reference Desk coverage, particularly during times when the Reference Librarians have other commitments (e.g., 1L instruction). During such times, the Assistant Director for Special Projects is expected to be available to assist on a flexible schedule, including extended periods of regular evening work (e.g., the month of October).

During Spring semesters, the Assistant Director for Special Projects is also responsible as instructor of record for the Law Library team-taught Advanced Legal Research course.
The Arthur W. Diamond Law Library offers its researchers one of the finest collections of legal materials in the country in both digital and print formats. In addition to a near comprehensive United States Law collection, there are strong collections in International, Foreign, and Comparative Law and a special section devoted to Japanese Law. The Law Library has significant collections from at least thirty different countries and a useful core of materials from many other jurisdictions. The library has a staff of 42 and offers an array of services to the students and faculty of Columbia Law School.
