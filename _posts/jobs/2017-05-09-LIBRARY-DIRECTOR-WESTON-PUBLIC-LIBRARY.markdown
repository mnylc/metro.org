### Description   

The Town of Weston seeks an energetic, talented, and thoughtful leader to become its next Library Director. A town of 10,200, Weston is a sophisticated, safe, bucolic town with an exceptional school system. Located in Fairfield County, Weston is about an hour from New York City. Our community library has dedicated staff, an engaged board and a committed circle of Friends to expand on our tradition of excellent service. 

The Library recently completed a $1.6 million interior renovation that provided enhanced meeting space, a new café area, new furniture, and a dedicated teen space. 
 
The Library is a welcoming, busy destination.  In Fiscal Year 2016, our gate count was 60,000 and circulation was 59,000 items. Last year, the Library hosted over 7,000 people attending programs or meetings. Attendance at children’s programming increased over 100% from Fiscal Year 2015, with more than 4,000 children attending programs. Children’s circulation was up over 20%. Community groups reserved meeting rooms over 400 times. The Library had over 45,000 patrons visit our virtual library. 

The department’s budget is approximately $476,000. The Library Director supervises a staff of eleven, including both full-time and part-time employees. We are a proud member of Bibliomation, Inc.
