### Description   

NYU Health Sciences Library welcomes applicants for the position of Education and Research Librarian, a faculty appointment in the NYU School of Medicine. 

The Education and Research Librarian will have primary responsibility for providing evidence-based medicine and related information skills training for health professions learners, including medical students and residents. As part of this role, the Education and Research Librarian is expected to develop and implement new innovative evidence-based medicine programming (e.g. developing curriculum and support for EBM in addition to the existing curriculum, identifying gaps in teaching and assessment of EBM across the continuum, etc.). This role is focused on undergraduate medical education, but is also expected to work in parallel with the Clinical Outreach and GME Librarian to provide education and outreach to graduate medical education programs.

In addition to this role directly supporting education, they will also support users by 1) serving as a liaison to an academic department(s), including providing dedicated support through clinical rounding, search and citation management consultations and workshops, and other support as appropriate for the user community, and 2) contributing to the library’s support of systematic reviews (e.g. leading effective systematic review consultations, building skills in systematic searching, and participating in research projects as appropriate). Depending on an individual’s professional interest, other possibilities within the library may exist.

The Education and Research Librarian will also be expected to conduct and present library research based on services, education, and outreach developed in their role. Additional responsibilities include serving on library and medical center committees and/or task forces as appropriate. 

The successful applicant will be someone with the ability to take advantage of a highly flexible work environment, build partnerships with new user communities, and develop new services and curricula. They will also have a demonstrated track record of drive, strong interpersonal and collaboration skills, innovation, and a personal commitment to excellence and innovation. This position joins the library’s Education and Curriculum Support team that is at the forefront of revitalizing the way librarians engage with evidence-based medicine throughout the continuum of medical education. The team currently is involved in the medical school curriculum across all years of undergraduate medical education and has targeted outreach in graduate medical education. The successful candidate will be appointed at the Library Instructor or Assistant Curator level. The position reports to the Head of Education and Curriculum Support.
