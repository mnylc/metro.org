### Description   

The Archival Collections Management Department at New York University seeks a skilled and knowledgeable professional for a 3 year, temporary Project Archivist appointment. The position is based in the Archival Collections Management Department (ACM) of Knowledge Access and Resource Management Services (KARMS), a unified archival technical services department supporting NYU’s archival repositories.  The Cold War Collections Project Archivist will accession, process, and describe new and existing Cold War era collections in the holdings of the Tamiment Library and Wagner Labor Archive. The incumbent’s work will be done in support of Tamiment’s Center for the United States and the Cold War, and will align with the research and curatorial needs of the Center’s fellows and curators.

New York University’s Center for the United States and the Cold War is a community of scholars, students, activists, and concerned citizens working on projects relating to the Cold War. Based in the Tamiment Library, one of the United States’ most important special collection documenting the history of radical politics and labor in the United States, the Center’s mission is to reassess the standard Cold War narrative by situating it within the wider context of the struggle for social and political change whose origins go back well before World War II.  The Center awards travel grants, dissertation, and post-doctoral fellowships for projects using the Tamiment Library’s collections; sponsors a seminar for scholarly work in progress, and organizes occasional conferences, lectures, book talks, and film screenings.

At the Division of Libraries, we are proud of our organizational culture and we are committed to building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization that supports a sense of belonging for the staff and communities we serve.
