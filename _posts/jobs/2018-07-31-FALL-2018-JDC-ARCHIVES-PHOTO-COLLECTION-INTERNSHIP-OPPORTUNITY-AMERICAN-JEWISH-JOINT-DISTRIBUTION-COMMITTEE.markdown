### Description   

The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) Archives’ Photo Collection contains over 100,000 images. These photographs offer a rich historical overview of JDC’s relief activities over the past century in 90 countries. More than 73,000 photographs have already been digitally scanned. We seek students for an experiential education opportunity to assist with image cataloguing and preservation. The broad range of countries and topics in our scope of this collection, which encompasses regions and time periods such as postwar Europe, 1950’s North Africa and 1960s-70s Israel, allows us to tailor projects to different interests.

Special projects:
• Adding to our online database the following photo collections:  
     o	Community life, education and health services provided to Moroccan Jews from the 1950s-70s
     o	Post-WWII Jewish refugees living in Displaced Persons Camps in Austria and Germany 
     o	Youth and elderly care programs in 1960’s Israel. 
     o	Assorted collections of JDC activities in Jewish communities of Bulgaria, Hungary, India, and many others
• Preparing unprocessed images documenting JDC activities in 20 countries (1940’s-70’s) with emphases on Israel, France, Germany and Iran for digitization and preservation.   

The expected schedule is 12-20 hours per week. Options are available in the NY office located in midtown Manhattan and our offsite facility in Long Island City.

•  Creating metadata and integrating new photographs into cataloguing system.

•  Conducting online research and fact-checking to enrich descriptive data for photographs.

Preferred candidates will have completed at least one semester of graduate work in archival, museum, or library studies, or art history.
