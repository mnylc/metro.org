In January 2005, METRO launched its Digitization Grant Program as an effort to support digitization projects involving significant collections held by METRO member libraries in New York City and Westchester County. This initiative is supported in part by funds from the New York State Regional Bibliographic Databases Program.

Since that time, METRO has awarded over close to $900,000 in grants to support 92 digital projects.

Funding is distributed on an ongoing basis for qualifying projects that aim to increase access and engagement with digital materials. Projects will only be considered that have a realistic project plan and clear evidence of the intent and ability to make digital collections publicly available online. 

Only current METRO member organizations located in New York City and Westchester County are eligible to apply for grant funding. 

<b>Applications for METRO Digitization Project funding for 2019 are now available. Applications are due by May 10, 2019. Please contact  Anne Karle-Zenith, METRO’s Associate Director of Business Development, at [annekz@metro.org](mailto:annekz@metro.org) to request application materials and for any additional information.</b>

<b>Institution: </b>New-York Historical Society<br/><b>Collection: </b><a href="http://dcmny.org/islandora/object/nyhs%3Amcintosh">Burr McIntosh Photographic Prints, 1900-1910</a><br/><b>Description: </b>Burr McIntosh (1862-1942) established his first studio in 1901 on West 33rd Street, across from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a meeting place of many of the society and theatrical people whose portraits he would take. This project will cover digitization of 3,825 photographic prints, to be added to 596 existing digitized photographic negatives from the collection, creating a comprehensive digital archive of this important early twentieth-century photographer who recorded the fashionable elite in New York City at the end of the Gilded Age. Most of the images in the collection are society and celebrity portraits. Actors Ethel and John Barrymore appear at the seashore; philanthropist A.G. Vanderbilt celebrates a holiday at his Adirondack lodge. The collection also includes images of children playing, professional New York theatrical groups, horse shows and events including polo and fox hunting, sailing at Newport, Rhode Island, and various buildings. The images constitute a remarkable record of high society and the world of entertainment in the first decade of the twentieth century, but the collection also includes unexpected material, such as the photographs taken in 1905 when McIntosh accompanied Secretary of War William H. Taft as the official photographer on his peace trip to the Philippines, stopping on the way in Hawaii, Japan, and China.The vast majority of the estimated 4,141 prints were made by N-YHS in the late 1940s from glass plate negatives taken during the period 1900-1910; the negatives were destroyed after being printed.<br/>

<b>Institution: </b>New York Public Radio<br/><b>Collection: </b><a href="https://www.wnyc.org/series/on-the-media-1993-2000">On The Media 1993-2000</a><br/><b>Description: </b>Since 1993, WNYC’s seminal program On the Media investigates “how the media shapes our world view.” This collection includes 200 hours of program files originally archived on audio cassette. The WNYC Archive's collection of early On the Media broadcasts (1993-1996) is significant because it is both a profile and a chronicle of the media just before and during the infancy of the internet and digital age. It is also a critical compendium of discussions on many of the issues involving the media, journalism, and reporters that continue to resurface regardless of era.  The show's lively and provocative exchanges provided listeners with a captivating look at the inner workings of news operations while exploring the impact of decisions by editors, producers, and media executiives on elections, public policy, and the shaping of public opinion and attitudes. The program first went on air locally in February 1993 and nationally in October 1995 with host Alex S. Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-awarded journalist known for for covering the press for The New York Times.  Among his guests were White House correspondent Eleanor Clift, media critic Jonathan Alter of Newsweek, Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff, author Ken Auletta, NBC-TV reporter Gabe Pressman, editor Abe Rosenthal of The New York Times, Tina Brown of The New Yorker, columnist Molly Ivins, critic Stanley Crouch, TV Nation's Michael Moore, NPR's Scott Simon, and Joan Conner, Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. Topics covered include coverage of the World Trade Center bombing, the Rodney King trial, President Clinton’s first 100 days, and gay and lesbian issues. The early broadcasts are archived as “airchecks” on analog audio cassette tape. These standard audio cassettes have reached or are approaching their manufacturer’s expected shelf-life.<br/>

She was the hostess of New York’s longest running German-language Stammtisch. Founded in 1943 by Vienna-born artist George Harry Asher and Bavarian author Oskar Maria Graf, the weekly gathering became a cultural home for Jewish and non-Jewish émigrés who had fled the Nazi takeover of their beloved Heimat but did not want to leave their culture behind. The group met for years in cafes on the Upper East Side until Glueckselig began hosting the group in her Yorkville apartment – and many of the documents in the collection are connected to this Stammtisch.<br/>

<b>Institution: </b>Staten Island Museum History Center and Archives<br/><b>Collection: </b><a href="https://archive.org/details/statenislandmuseum">Digitize Suffrage Periodicals</a><br/><b>Description: </b>Collection of 382 issues made up of 6,117 pages from two periodicals published by Women's Suffrage organizations in the 1910s: The Woman Voter, published by the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City between 1910 and 1917, and The Suffragist, published by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage between 1913 and 1920. The Woman Voter covered news of the campaign for suffrage in each district in New York City. It listed the officers of each chapter of the Women’s Suffrage Party within New York City, reported the results of party elections, and featured profiles of individual suffragists. Activists for the cause contributed opinion pieces, updates about planned activities, and lists of major donors. While The Woman Voter, focused primarily on New York, The Suffragist was national in scope. It covered political news and major events, but also listed individual donors, and occasionally solicited contributions from guest writers. Now that these materials are digitally available via the Internet Archive, this has become the most complete online collection of the two periodicals available to the public.  <br/>
