The Wilbour Library of Egyptology is one of the finest research libraries devoted to the study of ancient Egypt in the world. Library Special Collections include a full range of visual and textual documents ranging from fashion sketches to artists' books. We are also a member of the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), participate in its trailblazing web archiving program, and are leaders in the development of model information services programs.
