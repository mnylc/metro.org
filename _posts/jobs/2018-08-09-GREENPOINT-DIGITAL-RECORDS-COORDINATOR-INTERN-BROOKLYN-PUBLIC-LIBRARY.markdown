### Description   

As an independent system, separate from the New York and Queens libraries, Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) serves the borough's 2.6 million residents, offering thousands of public programs, millions of books and use of more than 1,100 free Internet-accessible computers. The Greenpoint Digital Records Project is part of a larger effort by Brooklyn Public Library to create an accessible repository for the environmental history of the Greenpoint community. BPL is currently constructing a new Greenpoint Library and Environmental Education Center at the site of the former branch. In addition to traditional library services the new facility will provide programs, information and collections that increase awareness and stewardship of the local environment.

 

BPL seeks to hire a part-time Greenpoint Digital Records Coordinator Intern to acquire digital versions of past and current local remediation reports, and make them accessible and searchable by the public. The project is funded by a grant from the Greenpoint Community Environmental Fund. 

 

The Records Coordinator will be based out of BPL’s Central Library but will also spend time at Leonard Library to review the records housed there.



### Responsibilities   


• Review current physical copies of remediation reports and determine which digital copies are needed. 

• Contact the issuing agencies to request digitally-born remediation reports and establish that future reports sent to BPL should be digital only.

• Create metadata to describe the digital records acquired.

• Create a public user guide for the remediation reports.

• Create a how-to guide for BPL staff for managing remediation reports going forward to ensure the Library is housing a greater number of digitally-born materials and fewer hard-copy reports. 



### Qualifications   

Master’s Degree in Library/Information Science, or Archives and Records Management, or pursuing coursework to obtain the degree

• Experience working with digital documents in an archive, library or records management setting.

• Working knowledge of library/archival metadata standards and practices. Some cataloging experience or coursework.

• Ability to work independently and manage multiple tasks and timelines.

• Strong verbal and written communication skills.

• Strong attention to detail.

This is a 12-week internship, paid by stipend.  Work scheduled is up to 19 hours per week.
