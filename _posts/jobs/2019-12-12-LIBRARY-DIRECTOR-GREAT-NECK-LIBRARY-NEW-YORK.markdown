### Description   

A Leader for Great Neck Library     

The Great Neck Library seeks an experienced leader to bring vision and patron-centric approach needed to guide this historic library system into its next phase. The library’s community on the North Shore of Long Island is home to prestigious public schools, an abundance of parks, restaurants, shopping, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Local history is rich with architectural gems and anecdotes both literary and maritime. The community is a suburb of New York City, which is a short train ride away.

Established in the 1880s as an association library, the Great Neck Library system consists of the main library building and three branches. The library has a service population of over 45,000 residents with a 2019 operating budget of $9.8 million and a current staff of 47 full-time and 47 part-time employees. A major renovation of Main was completed in 2016 after the building was closed for two years, and branch renovations are underway.
