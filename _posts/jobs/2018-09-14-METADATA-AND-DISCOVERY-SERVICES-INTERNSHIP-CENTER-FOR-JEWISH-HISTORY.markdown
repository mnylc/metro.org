### Description   

The Center for Jewish History (NYC | cjh.org) is the collaborative home to five in-house partners—American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum, and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.  When the Center opened its doors eighteen years ago, it made a commitment to preserve the collections housed within its walls and make them accessible to scholars, students, and diverse audiences by implementing a unique, shared services model across all five partners.

The Center for Jewish History seeks a Metadata and Discovery Services Intern, who will learn fundamental training on special collections cataloging by assisting with metadata remediation and catalog maintenance. The Intern will gain experience working with Ex Libris’s Aleph integrated library system and other Center library systems. The Intern will begin with remediation of existing MARC records; after becoming familiar with the library systems, the Intern can pursue a departmental project in line with her or his interests, such as rare book cataloging, preparation of encoded finding aids for import into ArchivesSpace, or performing digital assets migration. 

This is a paid internship is for up to 10 hours per week through December 2018, with the possibility of extension through May 2019. The Intern will report to the Senior Manager for Metadata and Discovery, but will primarily be supervised on projects by the Systems Librarian.



### Responsibilities   

--Create new or enhance existing metadata in online catalog and other library systems to promote discovery and access to holdings available at the Center.

--Apply cataloging standards such as AACR2, RDA, DCRM, LCSH, and MARC21 to cataloging rare and special collections materials, informed by best practices and standards for museums, libraries and archives.

--Utilize tools such as OCLC Connexion, MarcEdit, and Cataloger’s Desktop to perform original and complex copy cataloging.



### Qualifications   

--The Intern must be enrolled currently or recently in a library, information or archival science graduate program. This internship would be ideal for a student who is taking or who has already taken cataloging courses and wishes to gain practical experience. The opportunity may be of particular interest to those with a background in Jewish studies or computer science. 

--Effective time management and interpersonal communication are essential. Library catalog work alternates creative thinking with repetitive tasks; the Intern should be willing to apply her or himself to both. 

--Helpful but not necessary: reading skills in German or Hebrew; knowledge of Jewish history and culture; familiarity with database structures.
