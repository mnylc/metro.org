### Description   

The Columbia University Libraries seeks an energetic, creative, and team-oriented Head of Humanities & History to provide leadership and vision for research, learning, and collection development activities in support of Columbia University’s humanities and history faculty, students, and researchers. Leading a team of librarians, the Head of Humanities & History develops, coordinates, and supports innovative and effective research support services and collection building, in close alignment with the needs and priorities of humanities and history faculty, students, and curricula at Columbia. In collaboration with the Head of Global Studies, the Head of Humanities & History will develop and coordinate services and collaborations that support research and learning, setting goals and success indicators for staff and routinely reviewing activities to evaluate their effectiveness at meeting the needs of students and researchers. Additionally, the Head will continue to define and shape the role of liaison librarians, addressing the needs of interdisciplinary programs, initiatives and research. Crucial to this work will be coordination of cross-unit training programs and professional development opportunities for staff. 

The Head will play an equally important role in shaping evolving methods of collection-building for history and for a range of subject areas and programs within the humanities. In coordination with other units within CUL and external partners, the individual in this role will implement and support innovative strategies related to collection development, including collaborative and digital collecting initiatives. 

This new position reports to the Director of Humanities & Global Studies, a newly merged unit comprised of the Humanities & History team, the Global Studies team, the Burke Library of the Union Theological Seminary, and the Gabe M. Wiener Music & Arts Library. The Head of Humanities & History will be part of a four-person management team guiding and advancing the goals and mission of the Humanities & Global Studies unit.

The Humanities & Global Studies unit of the Columbia University Libraries directly supports the research and learning activities of departments in a variety of disciplines in the humanities and global and regional studies, e.g. Classics, English and Comparative Literature, Film, French & Romance Philology, History, Jewish Studies, Latin American & Iberian Cultures, Middle East, African & South Asian Studies, Slavic Languages, Theater, Music, and the Union Theological Seminary. We support an active network of interdisciplinary institutes, centers and programs such as the Institute for Comparative Literature & Society, the Institute for Research in African-American Studies, the Institute for Research on Women, Gender & Sexuality, the Institute for the Study of Human Rights and Columbia’s Global Centers. In partnership with other library units, Humanities & Global Studies provides support across the curriculum, with extensive engagement with undergraduates enrolled in the Core Curriculum, Columbia College, and the School of General Studies, along with research support for graduate and professional students. The unit also supports a range of research and pedagogical activities involving digital methods and tools in the Digital Humanities Center and the Digital Music Lab, as well as primary source research practices.
