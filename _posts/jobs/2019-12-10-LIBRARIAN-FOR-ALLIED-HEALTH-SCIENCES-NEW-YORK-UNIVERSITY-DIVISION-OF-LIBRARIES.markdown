### Description   

New York University Libraries seeks a subject specialist with primary liaison responsibility to the Steinhardt departments of Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Communicative Sciences & Disorders, and Rehabilitation Sciences, situated on NYU’s Washington Square campus. This tenure-track faculty position reports to the head of the Nursing & Allied Health Team within the Research and Research Services unit in the NYU Division of Libraries. This librarian will engage in an embedded service model, working closely with the liaison supporting the Rory Meyers College of Nursing, as well as librarians serving public health, social sciences, and related disciplines.  

Library liaisons at NYU contribute to the educational mission by establishing strong relationships with undergraduate through doctoral level students, faculty, and clinicians, providing in-depth information services to both on-campus and online students, connecting them to the services and information seeking tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs throughout the research life cycle. The allied health student population is increasingly “nontraditional”: adult learners with diverse backgrounds, professionally, culturally, and geographically. Online-only academic programs in the allied health sciences departments are a particular area of growth at NYU.

At the Division of Libraries, we are proud of our organizational culture and we are committed to building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization that supports a sense of belonging for the staff and communities we serve.

### Responsibilities   

The successful candidate: 

• 	Applies knowledge of the principles of evidence-based healthcare and the framework for information literacy to support  literature searches, evidence reviews, and syntheses.

• 	Provides embedded, curriculum-integrated instruction in the classroom, one-to-one, in small groups, and online via course management sites, research guides and video conferencing.

• 	Builds, curates, and maintains access to health sciences collections and tools in all formats, bringing an informed sensibility to the unique needs of an increasingly online-only adult learner student population.

• 	Consults and collaborates on evidence syntheses, in the “informationist” role, to reduce bias in the discovery, identification, retrieval, appraisal, organization, and dissemination of research findings.

• 	Consults with scholars on data literacy and management, and related scholarly communication activities for the growing degree programs in the health sciences.

• 	Represents NYU Libraries in a variety of capacities, including outreach and instruction to visiting scholars and clinical preceptors, and provides support for academic department accreditations. 


### Qualifications   


Required: 

• 	Minimum one graduate degree (master’s level or higher) for consideration. A second graduate degree will be required to be eligible for tenure. One of the two graduate degrees must be an ALA-accredited MLS or equivalent.

• 	Minimum 2-3 years of relevant academic library experience with instruction, collection development, reference, and outreach as a subject specialist.

• 	Ability to work collaboratively with library and teaching faculty, students, clinicians, and staff in a team environment.

• 	Expertise with core health sciences resources for literature searching, discovery, synthesis, critical appraisal, and citation management.

• 	Excellent oral, written, and interpersonal communication skills.

Preferred:

• 	Course work and/or background in a health sciences profession, health sciences librarianship, or a related discipline.

• 	Record of professional activities including research and engagement in professional organizations.

• 	Demonstrated experience collaborating with evidence synthesis teams.
