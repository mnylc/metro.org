### Description   

Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) is seeking a Map Project Assistant for a grant-funded digitization and online access project called Portal to the Past: Creating Brooklyn Historical Society’s Digital Map Collection that includes facilitating digitization, photography, and conservation; some preservation work; digital asset management; metadata preparation; and website coordination. Tasks entail handling delicate and valuable manuscript and published maps manipulating metadata for multiple online access catalogs, creating blog and social media posts, and making presentations to professional audiences related to the collection and project. This project intersects with the Revealing Long Island History project so that project staff will prioritize cataloging, digitization, and access to maps with direct and tangential relationships to the history of Long Island. Both project teams will coordinate activities to maximize the goals for each project. The Assistant’s direct supervisor is Julie May, Managing Director of Library & Archives while also working closely with the Map Cataloger and Digital Projects Archivist. 

About the Grant-funded Project:
BHS’s project, Portal to the Past, to digitize the institution's extensive collection of Brooklyn-centric flat and folded maps was designed in response to ongoing feedback from researchers and BHS staff with regard to current level of access to maps, particularly for the purpose of research and re-use in educational materials and academic publications. In addition, it answers the need to make Long Island materials accessible by overlapping with the goals set forth in the Revealing Long Island History project. The project will consist of five major activities toward the ultimate goal of delivering digital images of maps and corresponding metadata online for broad access: 1) enhancement of cataloging data to include GIS coordinates; 2) professional conservation, where needed; 3) boutique and mass digitization; 4) creation of an interoperable metadata set for deployment to online access tools; 5) development of a map-dedicated online portal
