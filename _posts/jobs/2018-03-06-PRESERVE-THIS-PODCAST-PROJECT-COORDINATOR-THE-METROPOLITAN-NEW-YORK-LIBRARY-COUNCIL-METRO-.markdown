### Description   

The Project Coordinator is a temporary, 20-hour per week position running from date-of-hire through December 2019.

The information and tutorials will be transmitted via a short podcast series, a zine, a website, a set of guidelines, social media, and several in-person tutorials. It will be the role of the Project Coordinator to help support these activities and manage the logistics of the grant.
