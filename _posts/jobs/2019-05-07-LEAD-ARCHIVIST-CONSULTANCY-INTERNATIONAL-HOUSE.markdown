About International House
Founded in 1924 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Cleveland H. Dodge family, International House is dedicated to fostering the next generation of global leaders. As home to more than 700 carefully selected graduate students and young professionals annually – representing 100 countries and more than 70 top schools and businesses – I-House is the destination of choice for the best and the brightest of the millennial generation. 

International House provides an unrivaled opportunity for residents to thrive through daily interaction in a culturally, politically, and economically diverse community that is both inclusive and proactive by nature. Its programs encourage diversity of thought and experience, allowing – indeed, ensuring – that the world views of the emerging leaders who come to International House are greatly expanded beyond their initial expectations and even their comfort zones. We believe that the core tenets of the International House experience – respect, empathy, and moral courage – can change the world.

International House’s alumni are Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, national presidents, diplomats, human rights advocates and are renowned in the arts as authors, singers, poets, actors, and choreographers. Past board leadership includes Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger, Dwight Eisenhower, and David Rockefeller.  



### Responsibilities   

Job Description 
International House seeks a Lead Archivist consultant. The consultant will establish and implement a robust, enduring archives program, including systems and processes, within International House. In the first year of this position, the consultant will have an extraordinary opportunity to initiate a vital institutional program that manages thousands of unique and irreplaceable archival records, raises the profile of the collections, and ensures ongoing preservation of the House’s legacy. 

This position will oversee a team of 1-2 International House Resident Archive Fellows and may oversee an Assistant Archivist. The Lead Archivist will liaise with senior staff and other stakeholders to implement year one of a two-year work program. 

The position is currently slated to begin on or about July 1, 2019, lasting through about June 30, 2020. If the institution secures adequate project funding, the institution may propose extending its contract with the Lead Archivist through June 30, 2021. No offer for this position will be made before June 19, 2019. 

Responsibilities 
Primary responsibilities will include leading the work of assembling and processing historical documents within International House and collaborating effectively with staff and with external stakeholders to develop functional archives for broad use and reference. These documents currently reside in storage areas and throughout departments; they have been inventoried at the box level (for additional information, see “Background” section below). The Lead Archivist will pioneer the work of developing an archive from these documents, balancing between high-level project vision and hands-on archives document assessment responsibilities.
