### Description   

The Columbia University Libraries seek an innovative and motivated professional for an exciting opportunity to join its senior leadership as the Director of the Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library*. The Director will serve as thought leader and advocate for organizational effectiveness, developing comprehensive strategies for Avery Library specifically and distinctive collections broadly, including driving innovation in areas such as digital collections development, scholarly communication, course and curricular integration, user-centered services, organizational design and change management, diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, and the ongoing professional development of Avery’s dedicated staff.

The Director leads an engaged and effective team composed of 25 FTE, 5 contract employees, and approximately 35 students. The Director is a member of the Libraries’ senior leadership team and partners with managers across the organization to advance the mission of Avery and that of the Libraries and the University as a whole. The Director oversees all aspects of Avery’s operations, including collection development, research services, access services, facilities management, and Avery Index* operations.

We encourage individuals of diverse backgrounds, cultures, experiences, identities, and abilities to apply for this exceptional opportunity to join an evolving Libraries and University community. Columbia University Libraries is a globally-recognized academic research library system, serving one of the world’s most important centers of research and learning in the most exciting and dynamic city in the world. Talented Libraries staff build, sustain, and make discoverable collections that transcend traditional boundaries of format and domain, keeping pace with a dynamic and rapidly evolving information environment and creating opportunities for users to encounter 4,000 years of human thought.

Our decisions are informed by new curricula developed to meet the needs of a more diverse student body, new and emerging areas of research from a broad spectrum of researchers, including graduate students and newly-hired faculty, as well as by perspectives from the diminished or entirely lost voices of historically oppressed, marginalized, or underserved populations and communities. As a workplace, the Libraries provide a supportive, connected environment where every employee’s perspective is valued and every employee is encouraged to grow. All staff members have an impact on Columbia’s mission to advance knowledge at the highest levels and make the results of research accessible to the world.
