### Description   

The Reversible Destiny Foundation (RDF) was founded in 2010 by Arakawa (born 1936 Nagoya, Japan; died 2010 New York) and Madeline Gins (born 1941 New York; died 2014 New York) to promote their work and philosophy in the areas of art, architecture and writing. RDF is dedicated to supporting research and greater public interest in the ideas and artistic practice of Arakawa and Madeline Gins through a range of initiatives to further advance and preserve their legacy. 

The RDF archive is in the early stages of organization. It reflects the multiple areas in which Arakawa and Gins worked, including art, architecture, film, philosophy and poetry. The diversity of contents and formats of the archive materials demonstrates the complex dynamic of two individuals working both as independently recognized entities as well as occasional collaborators who latterly merged to become a single entity working in the area of architecture. The archive encompasses both physical and digital materials in both historic and current formats. Arakawa and Gins’s practice also involved research into, and engagement with, specialists and experts from other areas including medicine, philosophy, and physics. 

The Project Archivist will work in close consultation and collaboration with the RDF staff and advisors in determining and realizing the direction and physical organization of the archive. The Project Archivist is responsible for identifying the project scope; developing and implementing personnel and facility needs; budgeting and financial management; and supporting the needs of current and new researchers. In addition, the Project Archivist will create an overall archive plan; set goals and timelines; evaluate outcomes; provide quality control for archival description; create policies, procedures and workflows; and implement strategies to support these activities. The successful candidate is an experienced professional who can organize and manage a significant volume of complex and interrelated materials. Proven expertise and experience in artists’ archives is a must. Experience in the recruitment and management of staff and knowledge of new developments in digital platforms is desirable.
