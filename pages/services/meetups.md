METRO is proud to support the work of our members through our METRO Meetups program. Each group is convened by leaders in our field around a topic of interest to our wider community.

Esther Jackson, Organizer

Open to all library staff interested in the coding, deployment, and design of library software, systems, and web services. This local chapter of Code4Lib, known as Code4LibNYC, aspires to channel the spirit of the national organization. We were formerly known as the “Library 2.0” SIG at METRO. We want to provide a forum for software and web developers and programmers, who work at area libraries, to discuss their ongoing projects.

With meetings and presentations held throughout the year we will provide a venue for professional development and a forum for open discussion of common interest.

## Prison Library Support Network ##
[https://www.meetup.com/Prison-Library-Support-Network/](https://www.meetup.com/Prison-Library-Support-Network/)

Manuela Aronofsky, Mary Mann, and Mia Bruner, Co-organizers

The Prison Library Support Network is an information-based collective that aims to redistribute resources and provide support to incarcerated people. Our work is rooted in our recognition of systematic violence that the prison industrial complex creates. We believe that information is a tool for prison abolition, and that we must create space for people who want to commit and redistribute their own capacities and resources.

## Racial and Social Justice in Libraries, and Archives ##
[https://www.meetup.com/Social-Justice-Libraries-Archives/](https://www.meetup.com/Social-Justice-Libraries-Archives/)

Diana Moronta and Andrea Battleground, Co-organizers

The Social Justice Special Interest Group welcomes all librarians, archivists, and other information professionals who are interested in activities on community-centered activism, social movements, and outreach. Through meetings, presentations, discussion groups, and other events, we will reflect on and rethink the intersections of libraries and archives with social justice struggles. Some questions we will explore include: How do the ways we preserve, analyze, document and mobilize our collections, instruction, and services connect with the work of community activists in their fights for racial, economic, and gender justice? What does it mean to have a commitment to social justice in our profession and practice? How does librarianship embrace, challenge, or hinder various forms of access to information, documentation, and archives?
