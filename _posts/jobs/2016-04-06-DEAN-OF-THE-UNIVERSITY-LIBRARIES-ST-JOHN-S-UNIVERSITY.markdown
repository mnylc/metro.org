The Dean of University Libraries serves as the senior administrative and academic officer of the University Libraries and is responsible for the innovative vision, strategic direction, policy development, and management for the St. John’s University Libraries on the Queens and branch campuses.  A sophisticated understanding of the role of technology in library physical and virtual services, space, and information provision is expected.  

Founded in 1870 by the Vincentian community of priests, St. John’s University (stjohns.edu) is one of America’s largest Catholic universities, offering more than 100 undergraduate and graduate programs in its six colleges and schools, with a growing number of programs offered online. The fall 2015 enrollment of 16,210 undergraduate students (including 4,883 high school students taking college credit) and 4,671 graduate students represents 47 states and 123 countries. The University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and 12 other major academic and professional associations and employs 1,450 faculty members (630 full-time and 820 part-time) and over 1,300 administrators and staff. Campuses are located in Queens, Manhattan, and Staten Island, New York, and Rome, Italy with additional locations in Oakdale, New York, and Paris, France. The University’s Division I athletic program offers 17 men’s and women’s programs in the Big East Conference.
