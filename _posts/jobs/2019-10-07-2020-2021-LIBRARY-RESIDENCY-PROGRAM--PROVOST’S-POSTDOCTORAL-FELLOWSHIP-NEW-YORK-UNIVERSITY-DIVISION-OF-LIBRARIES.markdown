### Description   

NYU recognizes the value of diversity in creating an intellectually vibrant and inclusive scholarly community. To that end, the Provost’s sponsored Library Residency Program supports promising scholars and educators from diverse backgrounds whose life experience and research experience will contribute meaningfully to academic excellence at NYU.


### Responsibilities   

The 2020-2021 Resident will work in the Digital Scholarship Services (DSS) at NYU Libraries. DSS helps NYU faculty, students, and staff incorporate digital scholarship tools and methods into their research and teaching. By helping scholars plan, analyze, visualize, store, share, and publish their work, our services work across disciplines to advance digital humanities and digital publishing at NYU and beyond.


### Qualifications   

Candidates who meet one of the following criteria are eligible to apply:
1)  Individuals who have completed their MLS/MLIS within the last three years; or
2)  Individuals who have completed their Ph.D. within the last three years or who will have completed their Ph.D. by September 1, 2020
 
The selection committee looks for evidence of scholarly achievement (honors, awards, publications), commitment to library instruction, experience working collaboratively to develop new initiatives, and the potential to develop as a library professional. In particular, applicants are encouraged to describe how they can support DSS efforts in coordinating digital scholarship workshops and training, including curriculum design, instruction, and training; outreach and community engagement; and building a program to mentor and develop intern and graduate student staff.


### Compensation   

Appointments are for two years and begin in September 2020. Fellows are appointed as “Assistant Curator/Faculty Fellow” and receive salary; an annual housing allowance; and research allowance and appropriate professional development opportunities. The University also provides a benefits package, including medical and dental coverage.
