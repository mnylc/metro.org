### Description   

The Lehman College campus is located in Bronx, New York and is a senior college within the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Lehman is CUNY's only four-year public college in the Bronx and is recognized as an Hispanic-Serving Institution.

The teaching load is 18 hours per year, and although the college is predominantly teaching-focused, faculty at Lehman are active in research, scholarship, and creative works. Service to the College, University, and community is part of the mission, as is a clear commitment to student engagement including advisement. Teaching is reduced for junior faculty over the first five years for scholarly development, and all faculty are actively encouraged to seek external funding. Opportunities are available for faculty development and travel awards. Lehman College and CUNY internal funding is available through competitive grants for scholarship support.
