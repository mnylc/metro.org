Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) is a vibrant, pluralistic learning community committed to the intellectual and personal growth of students.  With enrollment of nearly 27,000 students, BMCC is the largest of the 24 institutions comprising The City University of New York (CUNY). The College is strategically located in downtown Manhattan in close proximity to the artistic communities of Tribeca and SoHo, the dynamic downtown financial district, and the center of New York City government at City Hall. BMCC prides itself on the diversity of our students: over 41% are Hispanic, over 30% are Black or African American, over 30% were born outside the US, and they represent more than 160 countries of origin with over 115 languages spoken. Collectively we share a belief in the transformative power of education to further the intellectual, economic, and social vitality of individuals and communities—and in the role of community colleges in advancing equity and social justice.  BMCC’s tag line speaks to this common sense of purpose and possibility: Start Here, Go Anywhere.  As we strive to make BMCC the very best it can be— a leading community college nationwide— we are dedicated to building a diverse and talented faculty that is committed to excellent teaching, scholarship, and service within our multicultural environment.
