[Library Bytegeist](https://soundcloud.com/librarybytegeist) isn’t the only library podcast out there. You can find a list of library podcasts on the Circulating Ideas blog.

A couple you should check out:

## Book Club for Masochists
Hosted by a group of five librarians (who are also friends) who podcast about books that they read from a randomly selected genre every month. They did a [live  episode](http://bookclub4m.tumblr.com/post/162870952657/time-for-a-special-bonus-episode-which-apparently) from the ALA annual conference in Chicago

## The Book Squad
Produced out of Lawrence Public Library. The hosts just released a [“bonus length” episode](https://soundcloud.com/user-254416180/ep-06-parable-of-the-sower-vs-1984-i-am-not-your-negro-and-more-bonus-edition).

## The Secret Stacks
A podcast all about comics and libraries hosted by Kristin LaLonde and Thomas Maluck. The hosts recently posted [an episode](http://www.secretstacks.com/episode-31-get-out-of-your-silo/) called “Get Out of Your Silo” in which they discuss  library conferences they have attended, as well as Thomas’ Wonder Woman movie experience.

Information technology will change, audio formats will come and go, but libraries will continue to collect, organize, preserve, and make accessible the byproducts of our human experiences. Libraries have stories to tell. All we have to do is stop and listen …
