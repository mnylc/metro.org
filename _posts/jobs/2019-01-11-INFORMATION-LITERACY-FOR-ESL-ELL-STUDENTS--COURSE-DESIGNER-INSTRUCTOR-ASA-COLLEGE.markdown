### Description   

ASA College, a New York City-based, two-year, Middle States-accredited degree-granting institution, has an immediate opening for a TESOL/ESL/MLS-credentialed individual to take a lead role in the design and teaching of a ground-up adaptation of ASA’s LIB100 Research Methods, a required, two-credit introductory information literacy course designed for second-semester freshmen and an integral part of ASA’s General Education program. 

ASA’s students hail from all over the world and for many, English is not their native language. Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Turkish, French, Russian and Polish are among the most prominent languages represented, along with Haitian/Creole and a variety of West African and Caribbean dialects. 

Many of ASA’s ESL/ELL students struggle with the content of the information literacy course as currently delivered, not only in the reading and writing requirements, but with the critical thinking and information evaluation components as well. 

This ESL/ELL adaptation will fully comply with the learning goals, outcomes and rigor of the current course while being delivered in a mode most conducive to non-native English speaking students still grappling with the language. 

This is a part-time position of 28-39 hours per week, depending upon experience and qualifications.

The position will be based at ASA’s Manhattan campus near Herald Square and available to begin on February 12, 2019.


### Responsibilities   

Taking a lead role in the development, testing and teaching of this ground-up information literacy course adaptation. 


### Qualifications   

Minimum requirements include the following:

• 	MLS/MLIS from an ALA-accredited institution

• 	TESOL or ESL certification in adult ESL education

• 	Demonstrated ability in multimedia course design for ESL/ELL students

• 	Demonstrated experience in teaching adult ESL/ELL students

• 	Demonstrated experience in teaching information literacy skills

• 	Experience with Blackboard Learn LMS in a classroom environment

• 	Experience with LibGuides and LibAnswers/LibChat
