Establishes pre and posttests of commonly asked questions to measure comprehension after reviewing materials provided. Understands patient and family learning modalities, cultural or religious preferences, and client segments as well as individual patient or family needs, and uses this knowledge to select the right format for information intervention or service that is delivered to the patient or family, as well as the right follow-up to ensure comprehension. Maintains patient and family preferences for receiving information, and delivers customized training and communication when necessary. 

4. Develops and conducts classes for commonly asked questions or diagnoses. Uses such group sessions to build a support group or community around certain types of cancers that are better managed in therapeutic groups. This also can include diet or exercise as appropriate.

When possible, conducts usability studies to understand how patients interact with the portal, and make recommendations to developers to improve the patient experience.
