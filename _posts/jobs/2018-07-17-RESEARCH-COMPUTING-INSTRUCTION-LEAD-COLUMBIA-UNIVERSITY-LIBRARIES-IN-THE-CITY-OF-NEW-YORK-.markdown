### Description   


The Columbia University Libraries seek a creative, entrepreneurial, and user service-oriented Research Computing Instruction Lead to provide vision and execution for developing a training program around new approaches to research with a focus on computational literacies and data science. Working closely with Information Technology (CUIT), the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR), and the Data Science Institute (DSI), the incumbent will identify training needs, promote related resources for graduate students, and develop a comprehensive program to support those needs. The Research Computing Instruction Lead will work with volunteer instructors to plan and facilitate workshops, boot camps, and events such as lectures and symposia. The incumbent will also oversee related consultative “office hour” services and web and marketing communications. In addition, the Research Computing Instruction Lead will maintain continuous relationships and communications channels with University-wide academic departments in order to survey leadership, faculty, and students about their ever-evolving needs for computational literacy and methods for meeting these expressed needs. The incumbent will supervise undergraduate and graduate student workers and serve as Columbia’s representative on The Carpentries’ membership council. 

Reporting to the Director of Digital Scholarship, the Research Computing Instruction Lead will work closely with advisory groups comprising faculty and other stakeholders and will provide regular reports to the faculty-led Shared Research Computing Policy Advisory Committee (SRCPAC). 

Please note this is a three-year position, with the possibility of extension.
