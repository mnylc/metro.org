### Description   

Rider University’s Franklin F. Moore Library is seeking an innovative and visionary 
E-Resources and User Access Librarian to lead us in providing and improving access to print and electronic resources within a team-oriented, teaching library environment. This full time, tenure-track position, to start in the Fall 2018 Semester, requires an ALA-accredited MLS, along with at least two years’ experience in electronic resources management, collection development, and teaching information literacy across multiple disciplines in distance learning and traditional classrooms. The successful candidate must also possess:  excellent interpersonal, oral, and written communication skills; excellent analytical and problem-solving skills; a demonstrated ability to work both independently and collaboratively; flexibility to adapt to the dynamic workflows inherent to electronic resources; and a commitment to supporting under-represented groups of students in support of our climate of inclusivity.

This position envisions the idea of access holistically in response to the shifting needs of the physical and virtual library and its diverse users, including database and e-collections licensing, management, and evaluation; acquisitions budgeting for print and e-resources; and the implementation of best practices for interlibrary loan/document delivery, circulation, and assistive technologies. This faculty position will collaborate with other librarians to meet shifting priorities, needs, skill sets, and current responsibilities. The position does not directly supervise or manage staff. The successful candidate will proactively think outside of traditional silos to more efficiently acquire and make accessible needed materials in support of the teaching and learning process, including promotion of such materials. Specifically, the successful candidate will:  establish and maintain access to purchased and subscribed electronic resources, including databases and e-book collections; establish and maintain relationships with vendors and collaborate with librarians to evaluate resources for potential purchase and / or annual renewal; analyze usage of electronic resources and supervise the data collection in order to prepare all necessary statistical reports; provide leadership for improving traditional access services, including Circulation and Interlibrary Loan/Document Delivery; and evaluate collections and materials. A second graduate degree, scholarly activity (broadly defined), and value/service activities is required for interim promotion and for tenure. 

Preferred qualifications include experience in science- or psychology-related research instruction, access services and interlibrary loan document delivery especially knowledge of current developments and trends, and ERM, content management systems (Springshare), link resolver, discovery layer, and authentication methods (e.g., proxy server).  Additional preferred qualifications include:  experience working with ILS; experience managing serials/continuing resources; demonstrated knowledge of industry tools, standards, best practices, and initiatives related to electronic resource management, including ONIX, OpenURL, KBART, ERMI, SERU, COUNTER, and SUSHI; proficiency with data analysis and visualization tools; and knowledge of MARC21 and XML.

Moore Library Department faculty (librarians) all participate in library policy, public services, technical functions, and in one or more areas of collection development as well as in departmental and University service/governance. Rider University librarians hold full faculty status with access to fellowships and leaves, work a 10-month/205 day work year, have the opportunity to work closely with classroom faculty, and have abundant opportunities for service and input in the Libraries, wider University community, and library profession. The Moore Library Department values diversity among its faculty and is committed to building a culturally diverse intellectual community.
