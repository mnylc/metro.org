### Description   

The American Jewish Historical Society, the oldest ethnic and cultural society in the United States, was founded in 1892. AJHS’s mission is to collect, preserve, and make accessible materials that reflect the history of the Jewish presence in the United States from 1654 to the present. AJHS collections total more than 10,000 linear feet of archival materials, 50,000 books, photographs, art and artifacts, and thousands of digital assets.

In 2000, the American Jewish Historical Society joined a collaborative home at the Center for Jewish History, comprised of five in-house partners.  The Center for Jewish History is committed to a unique shared services model and supportive infrastructure that enables discovery of all five partner collections through one shared reading room and one shared systems landscape, and that facilitates access and preservation through the provision of digitization, archival processing, conservation, and metadata services to partners.

The American Jewish Historical Society seeks a visionary and proactive Director of Collections to both lead AJHS’s team and shepherd and grow AJHS’s collection. The Director will be committed to collaboratively advancing and innovating the cooperative framework of the Center as a whole and will join a large, internal community of professionals dedicated to maximal access to all collections for the benefit of researchers. The Director reports to the Executive Director of AJHS.
