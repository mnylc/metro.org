The Archive Center seeks candidates who will be equally committed to this goal and who have a familiarity in the use of digital technologies in an archival setting.  Minimally, prospective candidates should possess the ability and willingness to learn new technologies within the archival profession. 

The Assistant Archivist may also be asked to assist in providing reference service, including responding to research and donor requests and monitoring reading rooms.  Prospective candidates should have a demonstrated ability to work in a team-oriented approach with fellow staff members towards the Archive Centerâ€™s goals.  Prospective candidates should also have a demonstrated ability to work independently and complete projects in a timely manner, while maintaining a strong attention to detail.  Excellent written, verbal, analytical, organizational, and interpersonal skills are required.

Prospective candidates should also have at least one year of professional experience in a library or archival setting.  Familiarity with content management systems such as ArchiveSpace is preferred.

The Rockefeller Archive Center, an operating foundation with its own substantial endowment, is an independent archive and research center dedicated to the study of philanthropy and the diverse domains it shapes. It was established in 1974 to assemble, preserve, and make accessible the records of the Rockefeller family and the foundations and nonprofits established by the family, including the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller University.  Today, the Center's growing holdings include materials from numerous foundations, including the Ford Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, as well as from many nonprofit organizations.  It is also a major repository for the personal papers of leaders of the philanthropic community, Nobel Prize laureates, and world-renowned investigators in science and medicine.  

Located 20 miles north of New York City in Westchester County on a former Rockefeller estate, the Archive Center is easily accessible from major highways and by train on the Metro-North Hudson Line.
