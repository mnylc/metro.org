### Description   

Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) seeks a Studio Manager who will bring their expertise and vision to help us realize the next iteration of our hands-on, interactive facility for learning, making, and collaborating. Reporting to METRO’s Manager for Programs and Partnerships, the Studio Manager will bring a friendly, customer-service focused attitude to programming across our facilities, including the METRO studio, our event space, and our community kitchen.

METRO is a facility in midtown Manhattan that provides shared access to education, tools and equipment for librarians, archivists, and other knowledge workers. Our event space hosts more than 36 programs each year, ranging from hands-on workshops to meetups to symposia on pressing topics in the library and archives field. 

Our studio helps our members come together to experiment with new equipment and workflows. Currently, the studio features tools for digitization and media format migration. Programs featuring these tools have been successful, particularly those using our A/V media conversion rack and our podcasting booth. The Studio Manager will continue operating these services, while adjusting and evolving our service model to maximize the impact of the available resources. 

The ideal candidate will contribute new ideas and present new service design opportunities across all METRO spaces. Performances, screenings, exhibits, and any other events that bring our local GLAM sector together are all viable possibilities. METRO is always evolving. A healthy love of change and experimentation is an attribute we will be looking for in the ideal candidate.

The successful candidate is expected to be comfortable using online scheduling software, entering content into a CMS, and to be quick to evaluate and adapt to new software and other web based tools as they are needed for the job. They may also be expected to contribute to the development of internship or fellowship programs, and in addition they may manage those interns or fellows. 

This is a customer(member)-facing position. Candidates should be prepared to be available for workshops and studio appointments on Tuesdays through Saturdays. This position will be expected to cover evening appointments as needed. The Studio Manager works on site for the entire work week; this is not a remote work opportunity.

Compensation for this position is $65,000. We offer a comprehensive benefits package including health, dental, and vision plans.

METRO is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.
