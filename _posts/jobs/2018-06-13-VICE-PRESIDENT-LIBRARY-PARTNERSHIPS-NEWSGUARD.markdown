NewsGuard is fighting against fake news and for news literacy. NewsGuard analysts are rating and producing "Nutrition Label" write-ups for the 7,500 websites that account for 98% of engagement with news online in the U.S. Sites will get a Red rating if they intentionally publish false information, disinformation or propaganda. Sites will get a Green if they adhere to the journalistic standards that comprise the criteria NewsGuard uses, which are fully disclosed and transparent. With access to the ratings and write-ups online, people will have the information they need to know whether to take news from a particular source with a grain of salt. NewsGuard will restore accountability and responsibility for online news.
