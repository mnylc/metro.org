### Description   

Ballet Tech is seeking an archivist.

Ballet Tech began in 1974 as a ballet company, and has since morphed into a school. Our archives include photographs (slides, b/w prints, digital), writings, audio and video recordings, letters and other manuscripts, press clips, and other material. The collection is in need of organization, maintenance, and documentation. 

We are flexible as to the time commitment, in part because we aren’t sure how long the project will take.  Ballet Tech is located in Manhattan, just north of Union Square. 



### Responsibilities   

We are looking for someone who can:

• 	evaluate records for preservation and retention - some may be fragile and need careful handling, repair or conservation;

• 	suggest and implement a collection management system such as Collective Access;

• 	catalogue the collection and manage information and records;

• 	maintain a user-friendly, computer-aided search system;

• 	physically process the collection, as necessary, including refoldering and rehousing portions of it;

• 	identify ways of protecting and preserving collections;

• 	advise on the ongoing organization and storage of material.



### Qualifications   

The skills required are:

• 	a genuine interest in dance history and in preserving records for posterity;

• 	a logical approach to the work of identification and classification;

• 	the ability to skim and understand an extensive and varied range of material;

• 	attention to detail and accuracy;

• 	the ability to anticipate and respond to changing needs and digital media;

• 	the ability to work independently and as part of a team;

• 	good IT skills and an interest in applying digital technology to archival practice;

• 	competence in administrative procedures and project management skills;

• 	simple video editing;

• 	knowledge of and experience with archival standards and best practices;

• 	strong written, oral and interpersonal communication skills

Education:

• 	ALA-accredited MLIS or equivalent degree, with concentration in archival studies



### Compensation
