### Description   

The Brearley School, an independent girls’ school serving over 700 students K-XII, seeks candidates for the position of Head Librarian.
Founded in 1884, the school is a center of intellectual exuberance, attracting students from across and beyond New York City. Its mission has long combined outstanding academics with an insistence on larger purpose:  we seek to prepare our students for principled engagement in the world.  
A Brearley teacher loves to teach students who love to learn.  She or he has the wisdom and skill to spark in them a pioneering spirit as well as the ability to think critically and creatively. We count on our faculty to create and maintain an atmosphere of honesty, generosity and genuine respect for the thoughts, efforts and feelings of others.  Many are scholars, artists or athletes. We actively seek to build, nurture and sustain a diverse faculty and student body.



### Responsibilities   

The Head Librarian oversees the Lower School Library and the Middle/Upper School Library; members of the Library Department, its staff and volunteer staff; and the departmental curriculum K-XII.  She or he is responsible for developing and maintaining the collection and ensuring that it represents, reflects and speaks to a diverse population; managing the budget; facilitating and guiding the department’s review and development of its curriculum; teaching classes in the Library curriculum; and maintaining an inviting atmosphere in the library that is conducive to student learning.  She or he evaluates the members of the department and provides strong, sensitive support to them in areas regarding professional development, scholarly interests, teaching strategies and collegial relations.  As information specialist, the head librarian provides leadership and expertise in the selection and acquisition of information resources in all formats, as well as expertise in the ethical use of information.
The successful candidate will be able to create an environment where collaboration and creative problem solving thrive, to communicate clearly, to serve as a visible and active leader within the school community, and to ensure that the school library program is aligned with the strategic vision of the school.
 A Brearley education is rooted in ideas and practices that have been developed over time and through thoughtful, deliberate collaboration. We encourage new faculty to bring new ideas and fresh insights that might enhance a strong, beloved foundation.
The ideal candidate will have a genuine passion for and command of subject matter; a sincere interest in young people and an appreciation for the variety of ways in which they grow and learn; excellent communications skills; fairness, consistency and promptness in evaluating student work and in responding to students’ individual progress; the desire to collaborate; a collegial spirit and a sense of humor; and a commitment to helping students think independently and develop confidence in their own abilities.  A Brearley teacher also educates students through service in other areas, such as advising a small group of students, for example, guiding a club or chaperoning trips, and attending extracurricular events in which the students take part. 



### Qualifications   

We prefer candidates who have a graduate degree in Library and Information Studies from an American Library Association accredited Library and Information Studies program, or by the appropriate national body of another country. The ideal candidate will have at least three years teaching experience at the elementary and/or secondary levels and/or professional experience in a school library or public library.
