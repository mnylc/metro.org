### Description   

The Center for Jewish History (NYC | cjh.org) is the collaborative home to five in-house Partners—American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum, and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.  When the Center opened its doors almost twenty years ago, it made a commitment to preserve the collections housed within its walls and make them accessible to scholars, students, and diverse audiences by implementing a unique, shared services model across all five partners.

The Center for Jewish History seeks a creative, pragmatic, and insightful individual to become our Systems Librarian. Primary responsibilities include the management of the shared integrated library system and discovery layer as well as coordinating metadata remediation projects, management of authorities database, generating and maintaining customized reports, training staff, creating and maintaining documentation, and troubleshooting. The successful candidate can see both the forest and the trees, and will be able to balance system-wide implications with a detail-oriented focus and perspective.

The Systems Librarian will report to the Senior Manager for Metadata and Discovery. The Metadata and Discovery Services department is tasked with coordinating the interoperability and integration between Center systems that control, describe, preserve, and provide access to the rich physical and digital holdings of the five Partner institutions. The Systems Librarian will work closely with department members, as well as the Center’s Information Technology department, vendors, and stakeholders in the Center and Partner community to ensure that the physical, digital, and electronic holdings available at the Center are discoverable and accurately described.

•  Ability to work both independently and in a team environment.

•  Capable of fostering a collaborative environment and developing diplomatic, adaptable approaches to shared library systems.

•  General interest in library technology and the future of descriptive metadata and cataloging standards, particularly concerning discovery and access in a library, archive, and museum setting.

Preferred Qualifications:
