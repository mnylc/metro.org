### Description   

The Center for Jewish History (NYC | cjh.org) is one of the world’s great sites of research into the Jewish past.  It is the collaborative home to five in-house partners—American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum, and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.  When the Center opened its doors eighteen years ago, it made a commitment to preserve the collections housed within its walls and make them accessible to scholars, students, and diverse audiences by implementing a unique, shared services model across all five partners.  In recent years, the Center has taken on a wide-ranging educational mission and dedicated itself with new passion to interpreting historical sources in meaningful ways to as wide a public as possible. 

The Center for Jewish History seeks a Senior Manager for Public Services to take a leading role in increasing the accessibility of and advancing public engagement with the collections. The Senior Manager will join a dynamic team of colleagues dedicated to collaboratively advancing the Center’s shared services model and maximizing discoverability of collections that total more than 30,000 linear feet of archival materials, 500,000 volumes, thousands of art and artifacts, and nearly 50 TB of digital assets.

The Senior Manager fosters consistent, high-caliber service to both researchers and the five partner organizations. The Senior Manager reports to the Director of Archive and Library Services and oversees all operations in the Lillian Goldman Reading Room and the Ackman and Ziff Family Genealogy Institute, which are open to the public and together handle annually over 3,500 researcher visits, as well as the Scholars’ Lounge and the David Berg Rare Book Room.
