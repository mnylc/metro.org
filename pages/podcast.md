#### H4 Episode 14: Bye bye Bytegeist ... a year in review!

This episode was published exactly one year after we posted the first episode of Library Bytegeist. Molly Schwartz, METRO’s Studio Manager who also hosts and produces LB, decided to take the 14th episode to put together a kind of “year in review.” It’s a look back at the year gone by, including audio snippets from past episodes, a short history of how the podcast came into being, and a reflection on all of the changes that METRO has been through in the past year. And there are also a couple of announcements about what’s in store for the future of LB … so listen away and stay tuned!
