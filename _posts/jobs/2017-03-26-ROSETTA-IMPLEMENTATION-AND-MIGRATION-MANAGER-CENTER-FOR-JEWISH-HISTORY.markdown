### Description   

The Center for Jewish History is a collaborative home to five partner institutions: the American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. The Center and its five partners serve the worldwide academic communities and the general public with combined holdings of over 30,000 linear feet of archival documents, a half million books, and thousands of photographs, artifacts, paintings and textiles – the largest repository documenting the Jewish experience outside Israel.  The provision of access and preservation oriented services to the collections is core to the Center for Jewish History’s mission on behalf of researchers and the partner organizations.
The Center for Jewish History seeks a project manager for the implementation of the Ex Libris digital preservation management system, Rosetta.

Implementation will include preparation for and comprehensive migration from Ex Libris digital asset management system, DigiTool, which currently holds over 1 million digital objects and associated metadata, totaling over 40 TB of material. Implementation will also include training partner staff on the new system, facilitating interoperability between descriptive and preservation systems, and collaboratively developing workflows to support the ongoing deposit of digitized material into the new system.

The Rosetta Implementation and Migration Manager will report to the Senior Manager for Metadata and Discovery. The Metadata and Discovery Services department is tasked with coordinating the interoperability and integration between Center systems that control, describe, preserve, and provide access to the rich physical and digital holdings of the five Partner institutions. The successful candidate will work closely with department members in Metadata and Discovery Services, the Center’s Information Technology department, vendors, and stakeholders in the Center and Partner community to ensure that born-digital and digitized material will be preserved in perpetuity.


### Responsibilities   

Manage both short and long term benchmarks for the migration and implementation of the digital preservation management system, Rosetta.

Serve as primary contact with Ex Libris project team to communicate regarding 

Center preparedness and preparation for implementation, needs, expectations, limitations, and problems with Center’s Digitool dataset and entities during implementation.

Collaboratively work with Center Implementation Project Team and Partner 
Liaisons to prepare for migration from Digitool to Rosetta, including but not limited to, metadata preparation for import into the Ex Libris integrated library system Aleph, deletion or segregation of digital entities not migrating to the new system, data and load analysis, and customizing transformations for migration.

Attend Ex Libris training on the Rosetta system and experiment using the system with an eye to developing and supplementing documentation for depositing new material into the system. After Ex Libris training is complete, train Center and relevant Partner staff on updated workflows, once developed, for depositing new material into Rosetta’s permanent repository.

Once successful implementation of Rosetta is complete, manage day-to-day operations of the system. This especially includes troubleshooting problems, assisting with staff questions, and continuing to improve the workflow for the deposit of new material and interoperability with other Center systems.

Stay abreast of developments and professional best practices in digital asset management, digital preservation, and related topics. Learn and implement new technologies and approaches as appropriate.

Participate in special projects to promote and increase access to born-digital and digitized material held within the Center systems and other duties commensurate with the position, including project-based work both external to Center systems or within Center subsystems.
