### Description   

Small Data Industries seeks a consultant to join it’s Brooklyn-based team, in order to help our clients (museums, art collectors, artists, and foundations) solve technical problems preventing them from meeting their missions of preservation.


### Responsibilities   

Small Data Industries supports and empowers people to safeguard the permanence and integrity of the world’s artistic record. We provide consulting, strategy, and services to a broad spectrum of art world stakeholders in the areas of media art conservation, archival stewardship, preservation strategy, and digital preservation infrastructure and inventory and asset management systems. Our diverse and international list of clients includes institutions, art collectors, galleries, artist studios, and artist estates. Day-to-day activities—whether onsite at our Brooklyn headquarters, or on-location with clients—can include conservation treatment and documentation of an artwork, a strategy meeting with a museum executive, a coaching session with a team, time spent developing a roadmap for implementing digital preservation on a shoestring budget for an emerging artist’s studio, or research of emerging technologies being employed by artists. 


### Qualifications   

You are an expertly skilled communicator and a highly motivated self-starter. You are passionate about and have proven experience sharing your specialist knowledge and expertise with others to solve problems and help people reach their goals, but secretly you are still a nerd and a computer whiz at heart. You are comfortable leading a meeting in a boardroom, but if push came to shove you could configure a NAS, design a network, or write some scripts. You are interested in moving further away from technical implementation and closer to consulting but aren’t afraid to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty when a project calls for you to conjure your technical chops. People always tell you that you are great at making sense of and explaining complex things. You are passionate about art. You love to travel. You are organized, fastidious, and careful. Your ability to analyze a complex situation and derive a vision and perspective is unparalleled. If someone was watching over your shoulder while you used a computer, they would probably ask “how did you do that”? You are interested in helping to shape the culture of a young and up-and-coming company. You have a proven track record of successful collaborative projects.

Required skills and qualifications:
- Minimum 3-5 years experience working in the field(s) of digital preservation, information technology, libraries and archives, or other related fields.
- Minimum of an undergraduate degree. We are flexible as to what educational background candidates may have due to the diverse backgrounds commonly found in technical roles. Sure, maybe you have a degree in computer science and have dabbled in archives and preservation, but perhaps you were an english major who learned how to code and cut your teeth working in the field and have the experience to show it. Proven results and experience is more important to us than educational credentials.
- Superior communication, writing, and public speaking abilities

Desired skills and qualifications (in order of importance - any combination of - the more the better):
- Consulting experience
- Fluency in at least one programming language
- Knowledge of and experience with contemporary software development methods, conventions, and practices
- Experience with distributed version control systems
- Experience with contributing to or managing Open Source software projects
- Knowledge of enterprise digital storage technologies, platforms, protocols, and interfaces 
- Experience with digital preservation tools, techniques, and products
- Knowledge of digital preservation standards
- Knowledge of the materials and technologies employed by contemporary artists
- Art historical knowledge and expertise
- Experience working in or with the commercial art world
- Experience working in or with institutions
- Knowledge of metadata standards for cultural heritage
- Contemporary art conservation theory, techniques, and ethics
