### Description   

The Columbia University Libraries (CUL) seeks an energetic, creative, and team-oriented Head of Global Studies to provide leadership and vision for the support of globally focused research, learning and collection development. This newly created position will lead a team of librarians with expertise in area studies (African Studies, Jewish Studies, Latin American & Iberian Studies, Middle East & Islamic Studies, Russian, Eurasian & East European Studies, and South Asian Studies) and will provide strategic support to advance the collection, discovery and use of global research resources in alignment with Columbia University's global curricula, mission and initiatives. 

In coordination with other units within CUL and with external partners, the Head of Global Studies will implement and support innovative strategies related to collection development, including collaborative and digital collecting initiatives. The Head will be actively engaged in shaping inter-institutional collaborative strategies and resource sharing initiatives and will also identify and articulate needs for effective description and discovery of distinctive global collections. In collaboration with the Head of Humanities & History, the Head of Global Studies will develop and coordinate services and initiatives that support research and learning, setting goals and success indicators for staff and routinely reviewing activities to evaluate their effectiveness. The Head will continue to define and shape the role of liaison librarians, addressing the needs of globally-focused interdisciplinary programs, initiatives and research areas. Crucial to this work will be coordination of cross-unit training programs and professional development opportunities for staff. As appropriate, the Head of Global Studies will participate in local, national and international forums to advance the mission and work of the Humanities & Global Studies unit and will contribute to CUL-wide committees and initiatives. 

The Humanities & Global Studies unit of the Columbia University Libraries directly supports the research and learning activities of departments in a variety of disciplines in the humanities and global and area studies. We support an active network of interdisciplinary institutes, centers and programs such as the Harriman Institute, the African, Latin American, Middle East, South Asian and Israel and Jewish Studies Institutes, the Institute for the Study of Human Rights and Columbia's Global Centers. In partnership with other library units, Humanities & Global Studies provides support across the curriculum, with extensive engagement with undergraduates enrolled in the Core Curriculum, Columbia College, and the School of General Studies, along with research support for graduate and professional students. The unit also supports a range of research and pedagogical activities involving digital methods and tools in the Digital Humanities Center and the Digital Music Lab, as well as primary source research practices. 

Columbia University has a longstanding commitment to diversity rooted in values of inclusion and social justice, a commitment reflected in the curriculum and throughout University life. Columbia welcomes applications from candidates who share these values and who will foster their contribution to the University's educational mission. We invite applicants who have demonstrated creative approaches to empowering and mentoring staff, leading projects, solving problems, and developing user-centric programs, services, or collections. The Columbia University Libraries are comprised of a diverse and engaged staff committed to furthering the University's teaching and research mission through innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to excellence.
