We’re pleased to introduce the latest version of metro.org, built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub.

We consider our website a community resource, one that can grow and change based on your input and participation. If you see something that you would like to improve in our site’s design (we know it isn’t perfect!) we invite you to build and propose a different solution.

To edit our site, [clone the repository](https://github.com/mnylc/mnylc.github.io), make a branch for your changes, and submit a pull request. Updates like a new layout, updated color schemes, and content adds or edits are fair game. We’ll review your changes before making them live.

A few resources to get started:

* GitHub Flow: [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* Mastering Markdown: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

If you have any questions, contact us at info@metro.org and we’ll route you to our dev team.

P.S. If this is new language to you, hold tight; the first of many workshops on GitHub is in the works as we speak.
