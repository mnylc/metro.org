### Description   

New York University Libraries seeks an innovative Head of User Inquiry Experience (UIX) who will combine experienced knowledge of reference interactions and a sophisticated understanding of user experience to lead the critical and continuingly evolving range of services that directly support user inquiry.  Recognizing that library users’ information-seeking behaviors aim for the same results-oriented, satisfying experience whether they are channeled through in-person or online questioning or through “self-service” pathways to library resources, NYU Libraries aims to insure that users have a consistently positive and successful experience when interacting with services and systems. The Head of the User Inquiry Experience (UIX) will provide leadership and vision for delivering successful discovery and inquiry-response services, whether users are interacting with library information professionals (through in person or virtual reference) or directly with the library’s discovery system or other online interfaces.  The UIX Head will coordinate and lead efforts to design and implement reference and inquiry services and online interfaces that create an integrated, holistic user centered experience, an experience both informed by direct interactions with users and incorporating the best of online UX design.

The Libraries’ strategic plan emphasizes the need for continual organizational learning and innovation to meet the challenge of integrating library resources and services with new, ever-changing, powerful networked teaching, learning and research environments.  This is a newly designed position that will enable a knowledgeable, entrepreneurial leader to make a significant impact on the user experience at NYU Libraries.

The UIX Head is a member of the Libraries Department Managers Group and collaborates closely with user service departments across the Libraries, as well as the Web Development unit and Knowledge Access and Resource Services to create integrated services and to lead initiatives that ensure a satisfying user inquiry experience both online and in person.  The UIX Head will collaborate closely with the many units and subject specialists that deliver a wide range of in-person reference and consultation services across the Libraries, will design programs and lead the work of those individuals when they are participating in virtual reference services, and will directly manage a department of UX specialists who are tasked with continually assessing and improving the user experience for all online systems and services.  The Head of UIX will serve as a member of the Public Services Steering Group and other relevant committees to promote and develop a strong user experience culture throughout NYU Libraries. The UIX Head reports to the Associate Dean for User Services, Outreach and Assessment.
