### Description   

New-York Historical Society, a preeminent educational and research institution, is home to both New York City’s oldest museum and to one of the nation’s most distinguished independent research libraries. N-YHS is dedicated to presenting exhibitions and public programs, and fostering research that reveal the dynamism of history and its influence on the world of today. Founded in 1804, its holdings cover four centuries of American history, and include one of the world’s greatest collections of books, manuscripts, graphic materials, historical artifacts, and American art documenting the history of the United States as seen through the prism of New York.

The collections of the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library are particularly strong in local history of New York City and State; colonial history; the Revolutionary War; American military and naval history; religion and religious movements; the Anglo-American slave trade and slavery in the United States; the Civil War; records of benevolent and charitable organizations; American biography and genealogy; American art and art patronage; American architecture from the late 18th century to the present; and 19th and 20th century portraiture and documentary photographs of New York City. The collections include 20,000 linear feet of manuscripts, 500,000 photographs, 400,000 prints, 350,000 books and pamphlets, 150,000 architectural drawings, 20,000 broadsides, 15,000 printed maps, 10,000 newspapers, 10,000 dining menus, and vast collections of other ephemera.
