Lifelong learning and collaboration are central to METRO’s mission. We know that not all of our members have funds available to attend professional conferences, learning programs, and networking opportunities. We are very pleased to announce the return of METRO’s Professional Development Scholarships program!

A limited number of scholarships are available to individual members and institutional member employees who wish to participate in a professional development event, which may or may not be sponsored by METRO. You may request up to $250 to go toward event registration, and we’ll ask you to write up a few words about your experience, for possible publication on METRO’s Bytegeist Blog.

Scholarship terms, deadlines, and the application form are available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kc7kEEjZcU1pPe9uv85hCfYNcrZCHUyW9dcArUvqDTo/viewform?edit_requested=true). Please contact info@metro.org with any questions. Here’s to a well-informed 2019!
