### Description   

Hampshire College, an independent, innovative liberal arts institution and member of the Five College consortium with Amherst, Smith, and Mount Holyoke Colleges and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, invites applications for the position of director of the library and knowledge commons. The College is located in the beautiful Pioneer Valley in Western Massachusetts and contributes to the rich cultural environments of the college towns of Amherst, South Hadley and Northampton.

The director of the library and knowledge commons has chief responsibility for all library services and helps to carry out the mission of the library, as such, “The Hampshire College Library is a dynamic hub of people, technology, and information that serves as an incubator of ideas across all disciplines. Educating for change demands comprehension of the past and vision for the future.  The library’s innovative risk-taking intellectual environment fosters new ways of creating knowledge and understanding.”  The director plans, organizes, coordinates, and directs all aspects of library services in support of Hampshire's academic mission in a unique, “do it yourself” educational environment.  The director brings creative problem solving to leverage available resources and ensure broadest access to relevant resources in support of Hampshire’s unique curriculum.

The director will identify and modify library spaces to support evolving library services; identify necessary resources; and make judicious use of existing institutional resources in support of the library and knowledge commons. Responsibilities will include budget planning, oversight, documentation, and outcomes. The director of the library and knowledge commons serves as spokesperson, both on and outside of campus.
