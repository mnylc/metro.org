### Description   

The Bernards Township Library is a vibrant and active cultural center in an increasingly diverse community of almost 27,000 and is much valued by Township residents for its wide range of materials and services, and extensive programming.  The collection comprises almost 150,000 owned volumes with additional downloadable materials available on a pay-per-use basis in hoopla and kanopy.  Other online resources delivered through a well-used website support a wide range of information needs.  In 2018, attendance at over 1,000 Library sponsored programs exceeded 32,000.  The Library’s Leisure Learning continuing education series for adults in the Fall and Spring, is well-known and averages around 400 registered participants.  The annual library budget is in excess of $2.4M and is supplemented by a small amount of NJ State Aid and generous funds from The Friends of the Library.  Bernards Township Library is a member of MAIN, Inc. a consortium of 38 libraries and branches using a shared Polaris/LEAP system.  The Library also collaborates with other local libraries through reciprocal borrowing agreements with the Morris Union Federation (MUF), and the Raritan Valley Federation of Libraries (RVFL).

Library services and collections are provided by a staff team of 11 Librarians and 10 FTE’s.  A well-established Teen Service with dedicated space and staffing and the recently created Technology Center, supported by an Emerging Technologies Librarian are recent accomplishments.  A multi-phase space reorganization plan has progressed to Phase 3, with conceptual plans from an architect already in hand.
