### Description   

Create opportunities, empower people, and inspire ideas as the next Executive Director for Onondaga County Public Libraries! The Onondaga County Public Libraries (OCPL) Board of Trustees seeks an Executive Director accomplished in building and maintaining productive partnerships, working with local governments, managing budgets, and leading change. Working with an eleven-member appointed Board of Trustees, a committed staff (156FTE), and a $14 million annual operating budget, the successful candidate will provide meaningful, quality library services and programs to 466,000 residents in a socio-economically and ethnically diverse county—over 10% speak a language other than English at home.  OCPL is also supported by the Friends of the Central Library (Syracuse) through its fundraising efforts—the  #1 Public Library Series in the U.S.—hosting  17 Pulitzer Prize winners, a Noble Laureate and Five Poets Laureate. A complex organization—OCPL includes a Central Library (renovated in 2016), eight branches, and two community center outlets—and is also the federated public library system providing services to the 21 independent member public libraries in the county with a total annual circulation that was 3.7 million in 2018. Key opportunities for the new Executive Director include understanding the changing needs of Onondaga County residents; strengthening partnerships and relationships with internal and external stakeholders; developing and implementing a strong staff development program focused on collaboration, trust, integrity and respect; exploring new services and programs for OCPL and its member libraries; and creating additional funding streams.

Our Community. Located in the center of New York State, Onondaga County is home to the City of Syracuse. Syracuse serves as the focus for commercial and business activities and is home to world-class educational and cultural institutions, including LeMoyne College, Syracuse University, and the Everson Museum (designed by I.M. Pei and considered one of his six most important buildings). The City is also home and birthplace of Literacy Volunteers and Laubach Literacy (now Proliteracy). Syracuse has the cultural amenities of a large urban area—a thriving downtown, college and professional sports, world class medical institutions, music and ethnic festivals, parks, and other activities enjoyed by residents year-round including professional theater, opera and symphony (Symphoria). Work commutes are minimal and housing costs are quite reasonable. Located less than one hour from the Finger Lakes region and close to the Adirondack Mountains and Niagara Falls, Onondaga County, home of four seasons, is also a 4-6 hour drive to New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Montreal, and Toronto.
