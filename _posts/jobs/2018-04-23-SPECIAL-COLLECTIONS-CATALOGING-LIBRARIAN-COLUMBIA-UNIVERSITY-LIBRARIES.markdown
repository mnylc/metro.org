### Description   

The Columbia University Libraries seek a cataloger with strong cataloging and classification skills to provide original cataloging primarily for our rare and special collections materials. Reporting to the Director of Original and Special Materials Cataloging (OSMC), the incumbent supports the creation, organization, and maintenance of metadata to facilitate search, discovery, and access to rare, hidden, and general resources in various formats using a variety of cataloging standards as well as existing and emerging non-MARC metadata schemas and techniques, such as linked data. The position also plans and coordinates projects as assigned and performs complex catalog maintenance. 

The Libraries participate in BIBCO, CONSER, NACO and SACO. Catalogers contribute to planning, policy and procedure development and are expected to keep abreast of methods, guidelines and approaches for the bibliographic control of library materials.
