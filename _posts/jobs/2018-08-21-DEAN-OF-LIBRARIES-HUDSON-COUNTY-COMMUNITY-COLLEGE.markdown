### Description   

Institution of Higher Education


### Responsibilities   

Hudson County Community College is an award-winning, comprehensive urban college with two campuses located just minutes from Manhattan in Jersey City and Union City, NJ. The Journal Square library sits at the center of Journal Square in the center of Jersey City, next to a major PATH station and transportation hub, while the Union City library sits adjacent to a vital light rail station. 

Fully accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the College offers courses and classes in a wide variety of disciplines to the people and businesses of Hudson County, one of the most historic and ethnically diverse areas of the United States. The College was recognized with the 2012 Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT) Northeast Regional Equity Award, was a finalist for the American Association of Community Colleges’ (AACC) Student Success Award, and was presented with the New Jersey Business & Industry Association’s Good Neighbor Awards in 2009 for the Culinary Arts Conference Center and in 2012 for the North Hudson Campus Project, and in 2015 for the state-of the art, award-winning Library Building. 

In 2016, the HCCC Library was recognized by the Association of College and Research Libraries with its EXCELLENCE award for its innovative programs, offerings and services. Hudson County Community College is the first college or university in the state ever to achieve that recognition.  

Reporting directly to the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Dean of Libraries will provide leadership to meet the information and research needs of the campus and surrounding community. The Dean will articulate a strategic vision for the future of the College libraries, and continue to facilitate the transformation of the Library into a vibrant, student-centered, 21st century, academic and cultural hub. The Dean of the Libraries integrates diverse resources and technologies, collaborates with college constituents, and cultivates a dynamic teaching and learning environment. The Dean of Libraries fosters an organizational climate that promotes diversity, encourages innovation, and provides effective leadership to Library staff and students. The Dean is a central member of the Dean’s Council as well as the President’s Executive Council, and as such, participates directly in planning, policy creation, and the general academic life of the College.

This is an exciting opportunity for an experienced and forward-thinking Library professional to join an award-winning team in a highly collaborative environment that encourages creativity and innovation. Salary is competitive.
