### Description   

The Center for Jewish History (NYC | cjh.org) is home to five in-house partners—American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum, and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.  When the Center opened its doors sixteen years ago, it made a commitment to preserve the collections housed within its walls and make them accessible to scholars, students, and diverse audiences by implementing a unique, shared services model across all five partners.

In keeping with this mission, the Center for Jewish History seeks a Senior Manager for Collection Services to join a dynamic team of colleagues dedicated to preserving and providing access to the collections. These collections total more than 30,000 linear feet of archival materials, 500,000 volumes, thousands of art and artifacts, and 40 TB of digital assets. 
  
The Senior Manager will report to the Director of Archive and Library Services and oversee all operations in Collection Services, which is comprised of three departments: Archival Services, Digital and Creative Services, and Preservation Services. 



### Responsibilities   



• 	Oversee the Archival Services, Digital and Creative Services, and Preservation Services Departments, totaling 14 full- and part-time staff. This includes facilitating collaboration among the departments; guiding the development of new services (including exhibition-related services); and continually evaluating and fine-tuning workflows. 

• 	Determine and monitor spending in the three departmental budgets; invoice for work performed by Collection Services for in-house partners and external institutions; and track payments.

• 	Complete tasks associated with grant-funded projects, including proposing and helping to shape new projects; building and controlling all project budgets; supplying information to Finance and Development departments; collaborating with the Development department in writing both narrative and financial grant reports; and managing the writing of proposal sections that are to be drafted by Collection Services staff (as determined by the Director of Archive and Library Services).

• 	Promote and advocate for the crucial work undertaken by Collection Services, including participating in coordinated outreach efforts and maintaining statistics on output.

• 	Participate in other mission-driven, institution-wide projects as directed by the Director of Archive and Library Services.

• 	Stay current on professional trends and participate in professional organizations, and attend relevant conferences and other events/workshops as appropriate.

• 	Minimum of 2-3 years experience managing staff.
