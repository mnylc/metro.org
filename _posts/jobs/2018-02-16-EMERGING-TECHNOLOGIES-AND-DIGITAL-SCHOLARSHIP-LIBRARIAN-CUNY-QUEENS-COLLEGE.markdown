### Description   

Often referred to as "the jewel of the CUNY system", Queens College sits on 80 acres of land and is a place of contrast: an urban school in a suburban setting. It is a place where a large and diverse student body receives personalized attention. This formula has made us one of New York's premier educational institutions. With a mission to prepare students to become leading citizens of an increasingly global society, we offer a rigorous education in the liberal arts and sciences under the guidance of a faculty dedicated to both teaching and research. Our liberal arts, science and pre-professional programs earn us high rankings in prestigious college guides such as The Princeton Review America's Best Value colleges. Our students graduate with the ability to think critically, address complex problems, explore various cultures, use modern technologies and information resources, and have won prominence in nearly every field.

Benjamin S. Rosenthal Library is a mecca of campus activity and learning, drawing in thousands of students and faculty. Opened in 1988, it is named for the late Queens Congressman, who was a champion of progressive causes. The Library, which houses one million hard copy and electronic books, more than 3,000 media titles, and more than 50,000 online serials, plays an integral role in supporting the information needs of the students and faculty of the College.

Queens College Benjamin Rosenthal Library seeks a collaborative, motivated, and service-oriented Emerging Technology and Digital Scholarship Librarian to join its team of faculty librarians in May 2018.
The Emerging Technology and Digital Scholarship Librarian (ETDS), a new position, will work to develop a center for innovation and program of digital pedagogy in the Queens College Libraries. This space was developed through an educational technology grant and is the result of collaboration among the Queens College Libraries, the Graduate School of Library Science, and the Center for Teaching and Learning.

We seek a creative, collaborative librarian who can take the lead in the development of these new initiatives. The ETDS librarian will work collaboratively to support the development of the new initiatives to create high-impact learning spaces within the library that make use of new technology and digital pedagogies. In addition to leading relevant digital initiatives in the library, the ETDS librarian will support the digital initiatives already underway in disciplines such as sociology, English, and mathematics.


### Responsibilities   

As part of the Reference and Instruction Team, the ETDS Librarian will identify, develop, implement, and assess new technology that supports the digital scholarship of Queens College faculty and students. The successful candidate will assess the need for technology-based spaces within the library; manage relevant digital projects; develop grant proposals; provide training in digital tools both within the library and across campus; stay current with new trends in digital scholarship and educational technology; develop digital pedagogies; select and/or develop tools and instructional materials according to student needs; and participate in the college’s open access and publishing activities. The ETDS librarian will actively seek out partnerships with faculty and students engaged in digital scholarship as well as offices across campus including the Center for Teaching and Learning.

As a member of the Queens College Library Faculty, this position will participate in the library’s instruction program, providing course-integrated instruction as well as working with students in less-formal learning spaces. The librarian in this position will also provide reference assistance in person and online, and participate in professional and service activities that enhance the QC library’s mission. The librarian in this position will also serve as a subject liaison as needed.

The successful candidate will participate in professional and service activities that enhance QC’s strategic goals and the Library’s mission. A second graduate degree is required for initial appointment to the tenure track position of Assistant Professor, whose responsibilities also include scholarly achievement. If appointed as Instructor, which is a non-tenure track title, the candidate must complete a second graduate degree within 5 years to be eligible for the tenure track as an Assistant Professor.

The successful candidate will be flexible, collaborative, and capable of assessing and adapting to the changing needs of the QC community and the library.
