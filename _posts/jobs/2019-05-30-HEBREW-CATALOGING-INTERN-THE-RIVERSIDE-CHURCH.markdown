### Description   

The Riverside Church Archives welcomes applications from current graduate students in library science, information studies, preservation, archives, or a related program for a summer internship position in archival cataloging. The Riverside Church Archives has received a CLIR Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives grant and, in partnership with the Library of Congress, and the WGBH Educational Foundation, is in the process of digitizing its collection of ¼ inch audio reels from the former on-site radio station, WRVR. WRVR was an important pioneer of jazz radio and covered the Civil Rights Movement extensively. It broadcast lectures, interviews and panel discussions on wide-ranging topics, from homosexuality to literature to folk music to cartoons to political theory. It also broadcast religious services in English, Spanish and Hebrew.




### Responsibilities   

The Archives Intern will work under the supervision of the Project Manager to catalog Hebrew and English language audio materials from the collection after the digitization is completed. The intern will listen to the audio files and – along with information on the tape, its container and any other documents included – determine the content of the item and catalog accordingly. The intern will create archival descriptions; identify significant content in the archival material; establish name and subject access terms with Library of Congress controlled vocabularies; document the records in the collection management system and image any documents in the item containers. The internship may also involve physical processing, including arrangement of materials and basic conservation practices, such as rehousing.


### Qualifications   

To be eligible for the internship, the candidate must have cataloging experience, be fluent in Hebrew and English and have a general familiarity with and interest in 1960s society and culture. Experience with translation and audio transcription a plus. 


### Compensation   

The stipend for the position is $6800. The position begins in early July.
