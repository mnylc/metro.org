### Description   

The Girl Scouts of the USA Collection spans centuries, genres, and styles, and includes corporate records, personal writings, ephemera, media, scrapbooks, fine and decorative arts, farm and camp equipment, furnishings, textiles, sculpture, jewelry, silver, international gifts, product and memorabilia, awards and recognitions, and Girl Scout uniforms, badges, and insignia. The Collection is cataloged in the content management system, Collective Access. A public front-end site is currently being developed and will be launched in fall 2017. The new site is the next step in ensuring the modernization of public access to the Collection and in leveraging it in support of GSUSA’s vision and mission.  In anticipation of the public website, the Digital Metadata Intern, supervised by the Senior Collections Manager, will prepare and edit existing metadata of historical and cultural collections, most notably the Photograph Collection and Publications Collection, in the back-end site of Collective Access. The Intern will utilize user-centered perspectives and search methods to ensure accessibility, retrieval, and use. The Intern will also prepare legacy metadata for large imports into Collective Access.

The intern will be provided a workstation at the Girl Scouts of the USA Headquarters at 420, Fifth Avenue.
