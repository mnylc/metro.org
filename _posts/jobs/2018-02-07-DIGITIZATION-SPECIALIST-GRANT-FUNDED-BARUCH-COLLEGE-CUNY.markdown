The Digitization Specialist will assist with a grant-funded project beginning in early February and extending through the end of June 2018.  The Digitization Specialist will work on a full-time basis to digitize and provide access to print materials in the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) Collection.

As the position is grant-funded, no benefits are available (aside from New York State-mandated accrued sick leave).

The successful candidate will work in collaboration with the Digital Initiatives Librarian, the Digitization Project Team Lead, and colleagues to implement and follow a work plan for the digitization project; establish and refine workflows for the capture and storage of digital objects; input metadata; supervise student workers; conduct scanning according to established best practices; and provide quality control on scans.


### Qualifications

The successful candidate will have a Master's in Library Science (MLS) or closely related discipline. This position requires at least two years of experience working on digitization projects and managing workflows.
