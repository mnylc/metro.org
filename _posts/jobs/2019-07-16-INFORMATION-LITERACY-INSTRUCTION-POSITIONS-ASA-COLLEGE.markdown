### Description   

ASA College, a New York City-based, two-year, Middle States-accredited degree-granting institution, has multiple openings for qualified individuals to teach LIB100 Research Methods, a required, two-credit introductory information literacy course designed for second-semester freshmen and an integral part of ASA’s General Education program.

ASA’s Fall semester begins October 8, 2019 and runs through February 3, 2020. We will be closed December 23, 2019 through January 1, 2020.
