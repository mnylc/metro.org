### Description   

The White Plains Public Library has an opening for a Librarian I, Community Engagement.
Strong relationships with the community are the foundation of an excellent library, and community engagement helps create those relationships.
As Librarian responsible for community engagement, you will create connections between the Library and organizations and individuals to empower people to take ownership of the Library and its resources. 

Key actions include:
● Work closely with colleagues conducting outreach to build on this initial relationship and give community members and organizations a voice in developing programs, services, polices, and more;
● Facilitate conversations, listening sessions, and one-to-one meetings in which people can envision and express what they want from the Library. Support community members in generating their own ideas;
● Identify expertise and talents in the community and provide opportunities to welcome this knowledge in the Library;
● Create space and events for the community’s assets to be recognized and utilized;
● Nurture the development of skills and resources that enable an individual, organization, or community to achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently;
● Meet community residents where they are, engaging in activities and support outside the Library.

This librarian will be assigned to the Adult Services department, reporting to the Manager of Adult Services, but will work with all age levels as well as colleagues throughout the Library. In addition to the activities described above, this
librarian will conduct classes and workshops and serve at public service desks as needed. Experience in instruction is a plus, as is fluency in Spanish. Must be available to work evening as well as weekend hours. The successful candidate will also be required to pass a civil service examination and be reachable for permanent appointment.
