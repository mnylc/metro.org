### Description   

Growing Together – One City – One Future. The New Haven Free Public Library Board of Directors seeks an exceptional and dynamic leader to guide this 2019 National IMLS winner to further realize its Mission, Vision and Values and to build on its positive growth and that of the City. Recent visitors to the historic Ives Main Library are delighted by the transformation of an iconic main floor quadrant into a luminous, buzzing hub—Ives Squared—which opened last year as the welcoming front door for entrepreneurs, creatives, non-profit leaders, and community members. The successful candidate will lead the Library as it serves as a powerful catalyst for energizing neighborhoods through strong branch services for both children and adults, relationship-building with the City and many non-profit community partners, and workforce development. For additional details, see the NHFPL Strategic Framework 2018-2023. The Library, with a $5 million operating budget, a strong senior management team and a dedicated full-time and part-time staff (65FTE), provides services and programs through the Ives Main Library, four branches and impactful outreach services, including a bookmobile. Challenges and opportunities include completing fundraising for and overseeing the opening of the re-imagined Stetson Library branch, launching the design phase for a renovated Young Minds & Family Learning (YMFL) department, implementing the 2019-20 Technology Plan, and developing a Master Plan while completing essential facility upgrades.
