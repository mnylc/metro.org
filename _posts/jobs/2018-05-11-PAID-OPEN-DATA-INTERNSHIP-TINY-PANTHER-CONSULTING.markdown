### Description   

Tiny Panther Consulting is looking for LIS students and recent graduates to join an exciting pilot project in partnership with the NYC Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO), Pratt Institute, and the Mayor’s Fund.  

Since 2012, New York City has been committed to making government data freely available to the public; today more than 2000+ datasets are available on the NYC Open Data Portal.  This summer, we will be embarking on a project funded by the Sloan Foundation to help more New Yorkers access these resources. 

If “Metadata for All!” is a rallying cry for you, we want your help. 

People of color, women, and gender non-binary humans are strongly encouraged to apply!  

Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until 5:00pm, May 25, 2018. If selected, pleased be prepared to kick-off the week of June 4 and be available for part-time work through the end of September. 

We offer interns:

$20/hour, part-time, 2-3 days per week
Desk space at METRO 
On-the-job training in data analysis and NYC Open Data 
Chance to work with open data coordinators at multiple City Agencies
Opportunity to create portfolio-quality work


### Responsibilities   

We will review the City’s data dictionaries -- the user guides that go along with each dataset -- and create a Usability Guide to help the City with creating data dictionaries that any New Yorker can use.  


### Qualifications   

    Demonstrated interest in information usability, metadata, open data, government documents, and/or reference

    Familiarity with MS Excel

    Strong written and oral communication skills 

    Creativity, flexibility, and enthusiasm for jumping into a brand new project
