In addition to familiarity with subscription based electronic resources, the candidate will be knowledgeable about managing access to born digital and open access resources.
The Electronic Resources Librarian is a 12-month per year, full-time, tenure-track faculty position at the Assistant Professor rank. Library faculty have academic departmental liaison responsibilities that include collection development and management, information literacy instruction, and outreach. Located on Pratt’s historic 25-acre campus in the culturally diverse neighborhood of Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Pratt recognizes the strength that stems from a diversity of perspectives, ideas, backgrounds, approaches, and experiences. We aspire to continue to grow as a place that always welcomes and encourages individuals of all backgrounds to contribute to and be part of Pratt culture.
