### Description   

New York University Libraries seeks a liaison librarian supporting the departments of Art History; Museum Studies; Art Therapy and Art Education; Arts Administration; and other affiliated programs. The position also collaborates closely with the Librarian for Performing Arts in support of the Departments of Costume Studies and Cinema Studies. Because of the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the humanities, the Fine Arts Librarian will actively coordinate with other subject specialists, including those supporting the Performing Arts, Journalism and Media, and Classics. The ideal candidate has an abiding dedication to developing services for the highly diverse user communities of these programs, which draw learners and researchers from across cultural and demographic spectra, who range in focus from applied to research-intensive work. Library liaisons at NYU contribute to the educational mission by establishing strong relationships with faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, and connecting them to the services, content, and tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs.


### Responsibilities   

This position serves as the primary library liaison to the above areas with special emphasis on delivering a program of extensive and integrated instructional, consultation, and research support services; developing responsive and creative services for communities who are engaged in work within New York City as well as on the global stage; building and curating collections in all formats. Candidates should exhibit a strong public service orientation; a high degree of facility with technologies and systems germane to the 21st- century library; possess relevant scholarly communications competencies, including those related to copyright, fair use, and OER in the arts; and have experience helping students and faculty who are increasingly involved with the developing areas of Digital Humanities. Liaison librarians actively learn and apply new skills and knowledge in emerging areas of digital scholarship and research.

The Librarian for the Fine Arts is a tenure-track position based in the Humanities and Social Sciences Center in the Collections and Research Services unit of the NYU Libraries, reporting to the Head of Humanities and Social Sciences. The successful candidate will be deeply engaged and contribute skills and expertise to the highly collaborative work of the department and other units within the NYU Libraries, including a close working relationship and collaborative collection development with the libraries of the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW). The successful candidate works creatively with colleagues to implement and improve programs and services, to deliver physical and virtual research and reference services, and to take a leadership role on projects and initiatives.


### Qualifications   

Required:

• 	Minimum one graduate degree (master’s level or higher) for consideration. A second graduate degree will be required for tenure review. One of the two graduate degrees must be an ALA-accredited MLS or equivalent.

• 	Previous library experience in instruction, collection development, and/or reference.

• 	Minimum one year of relevant library experience in instruction, collection development, and/or reference.

• 	Ability to work effectively with faculty, students, and staff in a team environment.

• 	Excellent oral, written, and interpersonal communications skills.
Preferred:

• 	Experience in developing inclusive programs and collections and/or in working with diverse clientele

• 	Graduate course work in Art History, Studio Arts, or another related field in the Fine Arts.


### Compensation   

Tenure track faculty status and an attractive benefits package, including five weeks’ annual vacation. Salary is commensurate with experience and background.
