      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using Python, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use Python to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install Python and supporting software
      Learn basic commands for exploring data
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data 

      No previous programming experience required!
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies.

  description:
    text: "Go beyond the survey and into meaningful dialogue! Join us in this interactive
      workshop as we will learn multiple approaches and techniques to engage with
      library patrons, and collaborate, listen and learn. Explore how community engagement
      can improve library services, collections, and help libraries understand how
      their work is really seen by the community.  \nIn this workshop, we’re going
      to break up our time into two parts. First, we’ll focus on clarifying what community
      engagement is from the lens of a library; walk through the preparation process
      for these types of experiences, including setting goals, choosing the appropriate
      framework, identifying stakeholders, planning and logistics. Then, we will introduce
      the role of the facilitator, introducing opportunities to guide the conversation
      and set expectations. Throughout the workshop, we will use a participatory model
      to demonstrate tips and tricks for planning an engagement experience. \nAt the
      end of the workshop, participants will have the tools to:\n\n\nset achievable
      goals and objectives for the engagement  \n\n\nselect the most appropriate type
      of experience for your desired outcomes\n\n\ndetermine best practices for planning
      a successful experience with consideration for your context\n\n\nmanage expectations
      while leading productive conversations\n\n\n------\nThis class is a series of
      professional development trainings to empower METRO members to better engage
      with their patrons, facilitate community conversations around timely or controversial
      topics, and make more space in libraries for the productive exchange and evaluation
      of differing ideas and information. Each class stands alone but will work as
      a series as they build upon each other.  \nNovember 16th: Supporting Productive
      Conversations\nWant to host a conversation in your library but aren’t sure how
      to get started? How do you create space for a productive discussion? This training
      will help you build your skills for facilitating roundtable meetings and other
      public discourse in your library. \nDecember 7th: Participatory Decision Making\nLibraries
      both large and small need to garner input from donors, patrons, and other community
      stakeholders when making important decisions. This training will help you build
      a toolkit of techniques and approaches for facilitating productive brainstorms,
      planning, and decision-making meetings.  \n------\nAbout our instructor\nKristina
      Drury is a social entrepreneur, designer, and educator. Her mission-driven firm, TYTHEdesign,
      uses the lens of design and strategy to support social good organizations develop
      creative solutions, build their capacity and enhance their impact. Under her
      leadership TYTHE has increased the community impact of over 100 local and global
      social good organizations including the NYC Dept. of Education, Brooklyn Public

      Project Management. 

      Those words can carry an intimidating aura of official methodologies and tools you’re ‘supposed’ to use, words like Agile, Kanban, Jira, gantt charts. However, successful project management is often simpler than these terms would imply. It all boils down to good communication and information management - practices librarians are especially skilled at. 


      In this workshop, we’ll peel back the jargon around project management to get back to these first principles of communication and information management, and how they are expressed in good project management artifacts, routines, and tools. We’ll also work through case study exercises together.

      By understanding what is fundementally important to project management, you’ll be able to adapt your style and assess the right tools for different situations as the context demands, because projects and project management approaches aren’t one-size fits all.

      After this session, participants will:

      Have an understanding that project management requires good communication and information management
      Know how to assess the right tools for their project
      Know how to produce good written artifacts like meeting notes, project charters, and plans + practice good habits

      About our instructor:
      Ara Kim has spent her career pursuing interests in linguistics, culture, technology, and organizational behavior and has held a number of leadership positions at the intersection of these subjects. She is a co-founder of Related Works, a sustainable business building well-designed tools for cultural institutions to manage their digital materials, and consults on operational process at places like Data and Society and The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Previously, she held various product and project management positions at NYPL Labs, Google, and Etsy.

    html: How Do Search Engines Work?
  description:
    text: |
      It’s in your browser. Your operating system. Your phone. Your car. Your automated home assistant. And of course, it’s on your institution's public website. Search is everywhere. But most users, and even most administrators or engineers, know very little about what happens behind the scenes when you type something into that proverbial textbox. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive to understand how Search works from the ground up. We’ll cover classic information retrieval subjects like:


      Inverted Index


      Analysis


      Tokenization


      Character Normalization


      Stemming / Lemmatization


      Stopwords


      Synonyms


      Ranking


      TFIDF/BM25


      We’ll also briefly talk about the components that make modern search engines like Google orders of magnitude more intelligent and resilient than these classic technique

      About our instructor:
      Gio has been working with data, architecting systems, and leading teams of engineers for over a decade. He’s currently a co-founder at Related Works (www.relatedworks.io), which aims to build simple, intelligent products that help cultural institutions share their collections with the world. Previously he worked as a Staff Engineer at Etsy, where he lead the Search Ranking and Search Experience teams.

    html: The Universal Elements of Good Design
  description:
    text: "Everything in our lives was designed by someone, from the alarm that wakes
      us up in the morning to the book we read before going to bed. Across the myriad
      of objects, tools, and apps that we use every day, they were designed using
      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and
      sound. \nIn this three-hour workshop, we’re going to break up our time into
      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and
      review a variety of real world print and interactive examples to discuss how
      they impact the final design.Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
      and put them into practice together.\nNo previous design experience required
      to participate. This workshop is great for those that have an interest in design
      but have had little to no previous training.\nBy the end of this workshop, participants
      will have:\n\n\nAn understanding of the fundamental building blocks every designer
      uses in their work to create effective and compelling visual designs\n\n\nHow
      to use these fundamental building blocks to design for print and screen\n\n\nHands-on
      practice establishing designing and leveraging space, typography, color, and
      motion, and sound to create a unique visual language\n\n\n\nAbout our Instructor:Magera
      Holton, Co-founder at Related Works believes the best design is the one you’re
      least likely to notice. She most recently managed the Design Systems Team at
      Etsy, responsible for building core UX components and design guidelines utilized
      by product teams every day across the organization. She managed Buyer Experience,
      which focused on streamlining the purchasing experience and bringing Etsy’s
      unique content to the forefront. \nAs an individual contributor at Etsy, she
      patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows:
      checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at
      Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling
      the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not
      thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over
      renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.\n"
