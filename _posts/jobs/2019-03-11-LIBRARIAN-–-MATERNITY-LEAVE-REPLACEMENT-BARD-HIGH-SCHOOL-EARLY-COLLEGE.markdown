### Description   

The Bard High School Early College Queens (BHSEC Q) Librarian maintains and updates a library collection of rich academic databases, computers, books, and a national interlibrary loan resource-sharing program. The librarian collaborates with and supports faculty in student research projects, curriculum support and professional development, and makes regular classroom visits to demonstrate research resources and strategies.

Additionally, the librarian coordinates the BHSEC Q Speaker Series—supporting faculty as they recruit and host guest speakers in the library or other venues on campus. Although not required, the librarian may also teach a once-a-week library-related elective course. A faculty library committee and robust team of up to 25 student interns bolster the librarian’s work.  

The hours are 8:30-3:20, with professional development until 4:30 pm the first Monday of the month. We follow the NYC DoE calendar.

The successful candidate should have a current DoE Library Media Specialist certification and experience in education and/or libraries at the high school and/or college level.
