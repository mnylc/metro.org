### Description   

Plan for tomorrow as the next Library Director of the Des Moines Public Library! The Board of Trustees of the Des Moines (IA) Public Library seeks a forward-thinking and creative Director to develop and implement collaborative, community library services. The library serves 215,000+ residents from a central library (an architectural icon) and five branches anchoring neighborhoods by providing convenient access to library programs. Key opportunities include developing a new strategic vision, restoring hours of operation, and working closely with the City of Des Moines and with the Library Foundation to seek new streams of revenue. With a dedicated staff (93.7FTE), a committed Library Board, a $8.5 million annual budget, and a successful Library Foundation—the library can continue to be an agent for positive change contributing to economic development, community building and academic achievement.  As Iowa's capital city, Des Moines is a small city with big city amenities. Noted for being one of Expedia’s Most Artistic Towns in America and one of the Top 10 Places to Live in the U.S. (U.S. News & World Report, 2017), the city is a hub of government action, business activity, arts and cultural affairs—with much of the activity focused on the reinvigorated downtown area where the central library is a centerpiece.  The library can be a key participant with the city as it looks to the future with its Forward Plan and the Capital Crossroads Plan. Des Moines is also home to good public services and friendly, cohesive neighborhoods. Additional information on the library, city and position can be found at Des Moines Links.
