### Description   

The Klein Antisemitica Collection – one of the largest private collections of antisemitic objects – contains more than 2400 individual items, including posters, drawings, prints, periodicals, pamphlets, books, ephemera, and three-dimensional objects. In preparation for digitization by a vendor, the Project Assistant will create a complete item-level inventory of the collection, retaining the original arrangement of approximately 40 subject groups determined by the collector. As each group is inventoried, the Project Assistant will wrap and pack the two-dimensional objects for local shipping according to guidelines determined by project management. Of extreme importance is the careful handling of each item, maintenance of the original order of the items within the groups, great attention to detail in listing the spreadsheet data, and creating a packing list as each box is packed and numbered.

To meet project deadlines, the Project Assistant must complete the inventory and packing in three weeks, listing a minimum of 160 items per day. If necessary, a Collections staff member will assist in the packing.
