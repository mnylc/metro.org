JOB SUMMARY: The New-York Historical Society is seeking two productive and experienced catalogers for a grant-funded project to create catalog records for items in English and other languages dating from 1601 to 1800 in the Library’s Rare Book Collection.
Positions are funded for eighteen months each.




### Responsibilities   

ESSENTIAL JOB DUTIES:

• 	The cataloger will systematically review items in the rare book collection to determine whether or not they have already been cataloged.

Specific duties are as follows:

CATALOGING

• 	Creating MARC21 records in the Aleph cataloging system according to the rules for Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books), AACR2r, RDA, and LCSH

• 	Correcting and enhancing existing MARC21 records and resolving complex cataloging problems

• 	Performing authority research and subject analysis, creating copy-specific notes, and assigning local access points as needed

• 	Creating holdings records in Aleph, verifying call numbers in online and card shelflists, and modifying them if needed

• 	Adding the Library’s holdings to existing records in the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), updating and correcting previously added ESTC holdings, and reporting items not found in ESTC to ESTC staff

• 	Referring items needing conservation treatment to the Library’s conservation department, and working with public service staff to ensure consistent access to the collection

• 	Other duties as assigned

PROMOTION OF THE PROJECT

• 	Writing occasional blog posts on the collections or aspects of the project that are of interest 

• 	If space and resources permit, participating in the mounting of small exhibition

PHYSICAL DEMANDS:  The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by an employee with or without accommodation, to successfully perform the essential functions of this job.

EDUCATION: M.L.S. from an A.L.A.-accredited library school or equivalent.

EXPERIENCE:
