### Description   

NYU Libraries seeks a subject specialist in the life sciences to support the research and teaching programs of faculty, graduate and undergraduate students in biology, environmental sciences, nutrition, and global public health.  This librarian serves as a library liaison with special emphases on building and curating collections in all formats; developing a program of extensive outreach, instruction, consultation, and research support services; and delivering responsive and innovative information services.


### Responsibilities   

The Life Sciences Librarian collaborates on scholarly communication and data services initiatives and participates in collaborative research projects, including sponsored research projects.  Librarians play a key role in the educational mission of NYU by establishing strong collaborative relationships with faculty and students and connecting them to the services, content, and tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs.

The Life Sciences Librarian is a tenure track position based in the Research Commons at Bobst Library and is a member of the Coles Science Center in the Collections & Research Services unit of the NYU Division of Libraries.

Librarians at NYU participate in Library-wide committees and professional activities outside of NYU, and they also monitor developments and best practices to help ensure the excellence of the NYU collections and research support services.  The individual in this position reports to the Head of Science & Engineering for the NYU Division of Libraries.
