### Description   

The New York University Division of Libraries seeks a Head of Undergraduate and Instructional Services (UIS), a department with two core functions: (1) delivering outreach, partnerships, instruction, and services to foundational undergraduate programs and (2) providing expertise, leadership, and support for instruction that occurs across the Division of Libraries.  The Head of UIS is an experienced leader in undergraduate library services and a successful partner with schools and units across the university concerned with undergraduate success and research engagement.  The UIS Head is deeply knowledgeable about current trends and best practices related to undergraduate outreach, teaching with technology, information literacy, teaching, and learning.  This tenure-track position reports to the Associate Dean for User Services, Outreach, and Assessment and is a member of the Libraries Department Managers Group and the User Services Steering Group.
At the Division of Libraries, we are proud of our organizational culture and we are committed to building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization that supports a sense of belonging for the staff and communities we serve.

### Responsibilities   

The Head of UIS provides strategic direction for engaging with University efforts that enrich the academic lives of first and second year students, including foundational courses, high impact practices, student success initiatives, and academic support services.  This entails cultivating partnerships with such programs as first year experience, introductory writing, freshman seminar, undergraduate honors, undergraduate research initiatives, peer learning initiatives, the Academic Resource Center, and the Writing Center. The role also involves leading the effort to build community, share best practices, and organize professional development for members across the Division of Libraries who provide instructional services and support, including subject specialist and other functional specialists and technologists.  This position plays a key liaison role in collaborating with instructional technology design and support initiatives in schools and university IT.
The Head of UIS supervises three Undergraduate Instruction and Outreach Librarians and oversees the work of this highly collaborative department, which includes outreach and promotion, design and delivery of scalable physical and online library instruction, assessment of student learning, instructional design collaborations, and services to Global Academic Centers.  Responsibilities also include conducting programmatic needs and outcomes assessment, representing the Libraries on selected undergraduate committees and initiatives and managing departmental administrative processes.  Additional responsibilities include teaching library instruction classes and providing reference and consultation service. 
Librarians play a key role in the educational mission of NYU by establishing strong relationships with faculty and students, and connecting them to the services, content, and tools that meet their research, teaching, and learning needs.  They participate in Libraries-wide committees and in professional activities outside of NYU and monitor developments and best practices in academic librarianship.
