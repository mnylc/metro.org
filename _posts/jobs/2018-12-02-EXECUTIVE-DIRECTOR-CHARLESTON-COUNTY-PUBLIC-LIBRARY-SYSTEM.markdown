### Description   

Charleston County Public Library System seeks a leader to continue blending the area’s historical connections to education with an innovative, collaborative vision that focuses on excellence and growing opportunities for lifelong learning.  The CCPL offers rewarding and exciting career challenges for the successful candidate thanks to a $108.5 million building and renovation program funded through a 2014 bond referendum—overwhelmingly approved by three quarters of County voters.  The new library leader will expand and improve the system’s superb services, outstanding programs and exceptional customer experiences.

The new Executive Director will work with the Board, staff and County officials to complete the construction of five libraries—two new buildings and three replacement facilities—as well as an administrative center and renovations at 13 existing locations. The successful candidate will lead the System’s continuing efforts to grow virtual services, overhaul technologies, create innovative content and build sustainable partnerships with businesses and community organizations.  Currently, CCPL’s 16 locations serve more than 389,000 county residents.  In 2019, the Library will have an annual budget of $18.9 million provided primarily through a county appropriation, a staff of 298 FTEs, a dynamic Friends of the Library organization, and a recently formed foundation—the Library Foundation of the Lowcountry—helping position it to achieve even greater excellence.
