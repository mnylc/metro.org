## Membership Categories

### Members

To qualify as Members organizations must be located in New York City or Westchester County. 

In addition, eligibility for Membership requires that an organization operates a library.  For purposes of membership in METRO, a library is defined as an entity that provides reference and research services and has a separate and independent budget. Libraries include, but are not limited to, archives, public libraries, public elementary school or secondary school libraries, academic libraries, museum libraries, research libraries, and private libraries, provided they are eligible to be considered libraries. METRO does not certify or evaluate individual libraries except against our own membership criteria.

### Hospital Members

The METRO Hospital Library Services Program (HLSP) supports the work of hospital and medical center libraries in New York City and Westchester County. Eligible organizations are hospital libraries in not for-profit hospitals licensed by the New York State Health Department or member libraries serving such hospitals. Hospital members enjoy all of the benefits of being members, but as hospital members they have access to other categorical aid from New York State.

### Non-Profit Members

Associate Membership is open to any non-profit organization regardless of their geographic location or their official status as a library. Because METRO receives funding from New York State’s Office of Cultural Education to support specific programs, Associate Members are not eligible for some of the programs and services that Members are.

### Corporate Members

This membership category is open to any businesses that do not qualify as non-profit organizations.

All dues assume non-profit status of member. For-profit membership rates are available upon request.
