### Description   

The Wildlife Conservation Society Archives is seeking two highly motivated and detail-oriented individuals for a paid photo preservation internship.

Founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society is committed to saving wildlife and wild places worldwide. This initiative is carried out through science, global conservation, education, and the management of the world’s largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Documenting the history of this work, the WCS Archives includes records related to the histories of the Bronx Zoo, the New York Aquarium, international field work projects, and other WCS institutions and activities.





### Responsibilities   

Under close supervision by WCS Archives staff, the Photo Preservation Interns will be responsible for working with nearly 15,000 photographic negatives from WCS’s historical photograph collection. These negatives feature images of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium, as well as some of WCS’s early field study sites, dating from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s. The successful interns will clean and rehouse the negatives and will provide brief condition notes about them; they will also move the negatives into the Archives’ cold storage vault.

The Photo Preservation Interns will each commit to 14 weeks of work onsite at the Bronx Zoo, between September and December 2019, for a total of 210 hours each. The Interns will also have the option of continuing on with the project for an additional 14 weeks and an additional 210 hours, between January and May 2020.

•     Excellent attention to detail.

•     Demonstrated ability to set priorities and meet strict deadlines.
