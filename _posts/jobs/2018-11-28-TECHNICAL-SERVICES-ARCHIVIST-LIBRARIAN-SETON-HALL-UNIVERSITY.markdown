### Company Information   

The Monsignor William Noé Field Archives and Special Collections is the repository for the records of the Archdiocese of Newark, as well as the University Archives of Seton Hall University.  In addition, the archives maintains a manuscript collection that is particularly strong in the records of notable New Jersey political figures and writers.  Many come to the archives to do genealogical research, particularly in the sacramental records, and we regularly host classes in research methods and assist advanced university students and scholars with their research projects.  Special Collections holds a rare book collection with strengths in Irish history, Catholic doctrine and practice, and, to a lesser extent, modern American poetry and the American Civil War.  Special Collections forms a consolidation with the Walsh Gallery (Seton Hall’s art gallery). It curates and manages a permanent collection comprised of art objects in many formats, in addition to specialized research collections in anthropology and other fields.
